## Industry Context
*Current market dynamics and organizational pressures*

The biotech industry stands at a crossroads where groundbreaking scientific innovation meets brutal operational reality. The global biotech market was valued at $1.37 trillion in 2023 and is projected to expand from $483 billion in 2024 to $546 billion by 2025, reflecting a robust CAGR of approximately 13%. Investment is flowing, science is advancing, and patient outcomes are improving. That's the good news.

Here's what those growth numbers hide: In 2024, the FDA approved 38 new molecular entities for therapeutic use, a decline from 47 in the previous year. This decrease highlights growing challenges facing the field—clinical trials now demand greater complexity, increased data requirements, and diversity mandates. Biopharma sponsors face extended timelines and increased costs. Half (49%) of all drug developers identified rising costs as the top challenge in 2024. Patient recruitment came in second at 39%.

The 2025 Trump administration slashed NIH funding by around $3 billion, leading to halted early-stage research and layoffs at biotech-created startups. Developing advanced therapies remains extraordinarily expensive. Rising regulatory demands and long trial timelines amplify capital risk, especially for clinical-stage companies. About 72% of life sciences executives cite regulatory compliance as a top challenge.

Meanwhile, the convergence of biotech and AI brings concerns around dual-use applications, ecosystem disruption, and biosecurity threats. Delivering on complex technology like digital twins and living systems demands a skilled workforce, but professionals in AI, engineering, and regulatory science are hard to come by in biotech hubs. The sector faces a paradox: unlimited scientific potential constrained by limited organizational capacity.

Cybersecurity has emerged as critical challenge. In the first quarter of 2024 alone, weekly cyberattacks against U.S. healthcare organizations increased significantly. High-profile attacks include the ransomware attack against Enzo Biochem in April 2023 that exposed clinical test data of nearly 2.5 million people, and the February 2024 breach at Cencora that compromised sensitive patient data. The sophistication of attacks continues to evolve, with threat actors employing advanced techniques requiring equally sophisticated defensive measures.

## Common Operational Challenges
*The daily realities health and biotech leaders face*

Biotech companies operate at the intersection of cutting-edge science, rigorous regulation, and intense capital pressure. You're trying to advance revolutionary therapies while navigating FDA requirements, managing complex clinical trials, securing funding, protecting intellectual property, and building organizational capabilities that didn't exist a year ago.

Clinical trials present major pain points. Optimized trial designs, improved endpoint selection, and proactive timely communications with regulators are critical needs. But executing these well requires organizational capabilities most biotechs haven't systematically developed. Your clinical operations team understands trial design. Your regulatory team understands FDA requirements. Your data science team understands endpoints. But coordinating all three to design optimal trials requires cross-functional collaboration that organizational structures often prevent.

Talent challenges cut both ways. You need specialized scientific expertise, regulatory knowledge, clinical operations experience, and business acumen. Finding people with these skills is difficult. Retaining them is harder. Your best scientists want to focus on science, not organizational processes. Your regulatory experts are overwhelmed with compliance requirements. Your clinical operations team is drowning in trial management. And your leadership team is trying to secure the next funding round while keeping everything running.

The push toward precision medicine and personalized healthcare creates organizational complexity. As genetic testing becomes routine practice, novel targeted therapies enter clinical trials at increasing rates. Electronic health records are becoming genome-aware, making pharmacogenomics more accessible. But implementing precision medicine requires capabilities spanning genomics, data science, clinical medicine, and regulatory affairs—coordinated in ways most organizations haven't designed for.

Cell and gene therapies continue to lead biotech innovation in 2025, with the global cell therapy market valued at $5.89 billion in 2024 and projected to experience substantial growth. But developing these therapies is extraordinarily complex. You need specialized manufacturing capabilities, cold chain logistics, complex quality systems, and clinical expertise. Most importantly, you need organizational structures that can coordinate all these elements effectively.

Building on the success of mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines, the field of mRNA therapeutics is expanding rapidly into treating metabolic genetic diseases, cardiovascular conditions, and various forms of cancer. The versatility and relatively straightforward production process make mRNA therapies attractive. But "relatively straightforward" in biotech still means managing complex development processes, regulatory pathways, manufacturing challenges, and commercial strategies that require sophisticated organizational capabilities.

## Where Executives Get Stuck
*The gaps between strategy and execution*

Biotech executives understand their strategic imperatives. Advance lead programs through clinical development. Secure regulatory approvals. Build manufacturing capabilities. Establish commercial readiness. Manage investor relationships. Attract and retain talent. The strategies are clear. The execution is where things fall apart.

Take clinical development. Leadership knows they need to optimize trial design, improve patient recruitment, accelerate timelines, and reduce costs. But executing this requires coordinating principal investigators, contract research organizations, regulatory consultants, data management teams, statistical analysis groups, and internal clinical operations—all while adapting to changing FDA guidance and managing unexpected trial challenges. Most biotechs approach this coordination informally, creating bottlenecks and inefficiencies that delay programs and burn capital.

Or consider regulatory strategy. You need proactive communication with FDA, well-designed regulatory packages, clear development pathways, and risk mitigation approaches. But regulatory strategy requires alignment between clinical development, manufacturing, quality, regulatory affairs, and often commercial teams. In most biotechs, these functions operate semi-independently, each optimizing for their own goals, discovering misalignment only when regulatory submissions reveal gaps.

The challenge intensifies with manufacturing. Traditional equity financing is giving way to creative models like royalty-based deals, which grew at 45% CAGR and totaled about $14 billion in 2024. But securing any financing requires demonstrating manufacturing readiness. You need to show you can produce product at clinical scale, then commercial scale, maintaining quality and compliance throughout. Building these capabilities while simultaneously advancing clinical programs requires organizational bandwidth most biotechs lack.

The gap between strategy and execution shows up predictably:

First, functional silos prevent effective program management. Your R&D team makes scientific decisions without considering manufacturing implications. Your manufacturing team makes process decisions without understanding clinical requirements. Your regulatory team discovers gaps after development decisions are locked in. By the time everyone aligns, you've wasted months and millions.

Second, knowledge doesn't scale with the organization. You go from 30 people to 120 people. The founders knew everything and made all key decisions. At 120 people, they're bottlenecks. But nobody else has enough context to make good decisions because knowledge transfer has been completely ad hoc. Programs slow down despite adding people.

Third, organizational maturity lags scientific sophistication. Your science is world-class. Your organizational processes are startup-level. As you scale toward commercial operations, this gap becomes critical. Investors and partners expect organizational maturity you haven't built. Regulatory agencies expect process rigor you haven't developed. Commercial partners expect delivery capabilities you haven't demonstrated.

## How Rooted Helps Health & Biotech Leaders
*Organizational strategy that works in regulated, capital-constrained environments*

We don't arrive with generic frameworks about organizational transformation. We come with approaches specifically designed for biotech's unique challenges—balancing scientific innovation with regulatory compliance, managing complex cross-functional programs, and building organizational capability while conserving capital.

**Organizational Network Analysis for Biotech**

In biotech companies, understanding organizational dynamics is critical because programs succeed or fail based on cross-functional coordination. Clinical development requires dozens of people across multiple functions collaborating effectively. Manufacturing scale-up requires engineers, scientists, quality experts, and operations working in concert. Regulatory submissions require inputs from every function.

Our ONA reveals how your organization actually coordinates these complex efforts. We'll show you that program decisions run through informal networks rather than formal governance. We'll show you where information flow breaks down between R&D and manufacturing. We'll show you which key person dependencies create risk and what happens if those people leave.

We worked with a gene therapy company struggling to advance their lead program through IND-enabling studies. They had brilliant science, strong funding, and talented people. But the program was six months behind schedule and burning cash faster than projected. Our ONA revealed that program coordination required alignment across seven different functional leaders, but there was no regular forum where they all came together. Decisions got made sequentially through bilateral conversations, creating inconsistencies and delays. We didn't add program management overhead—we redesigned coordination structures to create systematic alignment. The program accelerated and reached IND filing ahead of revised timeline.

**Change Management in Biotech Development**

Biotech companies face continuous change—new clinical data, evolving regulatory guidance, manufacturing challenges, funding conditions, strategic pivots. Most biotech leaders assume their teams handle change well because the industry demands constant adaptation. But there's a difference between scientific adaptation and organizational change.

Your teams excel at scientific problem-solving—adapting protocols when experiments fail, redesigning assays when results are unclear, pivoting strategies when data suggest new directions. They struggle with organizational change—shifting how teams collaborate, adopting new governance models, changing decision-making processes.

Our OCM work addresses this distinction. When you're transitioning from research-stage to development-stage operations, the organizational shift is profound. Research culture values exploration, publication, and scientific freedom. Development culture values discipline, documentation, and regulatory compliance. Managing this transition requires more than announcing new processes—it requires changing deeply held assumptions about how science should be done.

A biotech company transitioning from platform development to clinical-stage programs implemented new quality systems and regulatory processes. Scientific teams resisted—they viewed the requirements as bureaucratic obstacles slowing science. Compliance was terrible. We didn't just train people on procedures—we helped scientists understand how regulatory discipline actually enabled clinical development. We showed how documentation quality accelerated regulatory interactions. We demonstrated how process rigor prevented costly manufacturing failures. We shifted the narrative from "compliance slows us down" to "compliance enables our science to help patients." Compliance adoption went from 34% to 91%.

**Business Process Engineering for Biotech Operations**

Biotech operations involve interconnected processes spanning discovery, development, manufacturing, quality, regulatory affairs, and commercialization. Most processes evolved organically as companies grew, were designed for earlier development stages, or were borrowed from other companies without adaptation to your specific needs.

Our BPE work redesigns operations for current and future needs while accounting for regulatory requirements and organizational realities. When we map your clinical development operations, we're not just documenting procedures. We're identifying where handoffs create delays, where information doesn't flow, where quality gates create bottlenecks, where organizational structures create inefficiencies, and where process redesign improves outcomes without compromising compliance.

A cell therapy company had manufacturing processes that couldn't scale. They could produce enough product for early clinical trials but couldn't reach commercial-scale manufacturing. The problem wasn't the science—it was process design. Their manufacturing process assumed hands-on involvement from founders at critical steps. Those steps couldn't scale. We redesigned manufacturing processes to systematize founder expertise, created documented procedures that maintained quality without founder involvement, built quality systems that enabled consistent production, and trained manufacturing teams to execute independently. They reached commercial-scale manufacturing 14 months ahead of revised timeline.

**Organizational Development & Effectiveness**

Biotech companies face unique capability development challenges. You need to build scientific expertise, regulatory knowledge, clinical operations skills, manufacturing capabilities, and quality systems—often simultaneously. Traditional capability development approaches don't work because there's no time for extensive training, skills are highly specialized, and you're building capabilities in areas where few people have experience.

Our OD&E work creates capability development approaches for biotech realities. We help you identify critical capabilities, assess current capability levels, design development programs that happen in the flow of work, and create systems that build organizational capability systematically.

A biotech company needed to develop clinical operations capabilities as they advanced multiple programs into the clinic. Hiring experienced clinical operations people was difficult—competition for talent was fierce and costs were prohibitive. Instead, we identified their most capable clinical team members, documented their expertise, built role-based learning paths, created structured mentorship programs, and designed progression frameworks that clarified capability expectations at each level. They developed world-class clinical operations capability with 60% fewer senior hires than originally planned. Time to competency for new clinical team members decreased from 8 months to 12 weeks.

## Why Mid-Market Health & Biotech Leaders Work With Rooted
*What makes us different from the Big 5*

The large consultancies will sell you multi-year transformation programs with elaborate frameworks, maturity models, and hundreds of deliverables. They'll bring in people who understand corporate processes but have never actually advanced a drug through clinical development or navigated a BLA submission.

We're different. Our team includes people who've actually worked in biotech, managed clinical programs, built manufacturing operations, and dealt with the realities of regulated drug development. We understand the difference between what works in a slide deck and what works when you're facing an FDA clinical hold.

We focus on mid-market biotech because that's where organizational strategy creates competitive advantage. Large pharma has resources to absorb inefficiency. Early-stage biotechs are small enough that founders can coordinate everything. Mid-market biotechs have real organizational complexity but need solutions that work within capital constraints.

Our engagements are designed for biotech realities. We deliver value in months, not years. We work with your capital constraints—we're not going to recommend hiring 20 people when you can build capability with 5. We build internal capability rather than creating dependency. And we understand that every dollar and every month matters when you're racing toward clinical milestones.

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value
*Real situations where organizational strategy makes the difference*

**Scenario 1: Accelerating Clinical Development Through Organizational Redesign**

A mid-stage biotech with three clinical programs was chronically behind schedule. Each program was 4-8 months delayed. Investors were concerned. Leadership kept pushing for faster execution. The clinical team kept working harder. Progress remained slow.

The problem wasn't effort or competence—it was organizational design. Clinical development required coordination across internal clinical operations, medical affairs, regulatory, manufacturing, quality, data management, biostatistics, and numerous external vendors. Each group had its own priorities and timelines. Nobody owned end-to-end program delivery. Coordination happened through email and ad hoc meetings. Decisions required consensus across too many stakeholders.

Through ONA, we mapped actual program coordination patterns and identified bottlenecks. We redesigned organizational structures to create end-to-end program leadership. We clarified decision rights at different levels. We established coordination rhythms that worked with program realities. We built information-sharing mechanisms so all functions had visibility into program status and could adapt proactively.

**Measurable outcomes:** All three programs accelerated significantly, lead program reached primary endpoint readout 5 months ahead of revised schedule, program operating costs decreased by 28%, cross-functional coordination time decreased by 61%, employee satisfaction with program management improved from 4.7 to 8.3 (out of 10), secured additional funding based on improved execution track record.

**Scenario 2: Building Manufacturing Capabilities for Commercial Readiness**

A late-stage biotech with promising Phase 3 data needed to build commercial manufacturing capabilities. They had excellent clinical-scale manufacturing. Commercial scale was different—different equipment, different processes, different quality systems, different regulatory requirements, and different organizational capabilities.

They tried hiring experienced manufacturing people from pharma. Those hires struggled. The company's informal processes, research-oriented culture, and startup environment clashed with pharma-trained employees' expectations. Turnover was high. Manufacturing scale-up was failing. Commercial launch was at risk.

The problem wasn't the hires—it was organizational readiness. You can't just drop pharma processes into a biotech environment. We helped them build manufacturing capabilities that worked with their culture while meeting commercial requirements. We designed quality systems that maintained compliance without creating pharma-level bureaucracy. We created training that helped research-oriented employees understand manufacturing discipline. We built bridges between research culture and manufacturing culture.

Most importantly, we didn't try to turn them into pharma—we helped them build commercial-ready manufacturing capabilities that fit their organizational identity.

**Measurable outcomes:** Manufacturing scale-up completed 9 months ahead of revised timeline, manufacturing talent retention improved from 52% to 87%, commercial manufacturing cost per batch 23% lower than originally projected, passed pre-approval inspection without major findings, product launch delivered on schedule (rare achievement in biotech).

**Scenario 3: Managing Rapid Growth Post-Financing**

A biotech raised a $180M Series C and needed to go from 65 to 220 people in 18 months to advance multiple programs. They started hiring aggressively. Six months in, organizational dysfunction was severe. Decision-making slowed. Knowledge transfer failed. Culture fractured. Programs weren't accelerating despite tripling headcount.

The problem was organizational scaling. They'd grown headcount but not organizational capability. Their informal processes broke at scale. Their founder-centric decision-making created bottlenecks. Their research culture clashed with development discipline. New employees took 6+ months to become productive because onboarding was ad hoc.

We didn't tell them to slow hiring—their timelines were real. Instead, we helped them build organizational capability faster. We designed organizational structures appropriate for 200+ people. We created systematic onboarding that transferred knowledge efficiently. We built leadership capabilities in the founding team. We clarified decision rights so founders weren't bottlenecks. We established communication rhythms that worked at scale.

**Measurable outcomes:** Successfully scaled to 225 employees while maintaining velocity, new employee time-to-productivity decreased from 6 months to 10 weeks, programs advanced on or ahead of timeline despite organizational growth, employee engagement scores improved from 6.1 to 8.4 (out of 10), founder bandwidth freed up by 40% through effective delegation.

**Scenario 4: Post-Acquisition Integration of Platform Technology**

A mid-stage biotech acquired a platform technology company to enhance their pipeline. The acquired company had brilliant technology but different culture, different processes, and different ways of working. The acquiring company tried to immediately integrate teams and standardize processes. The acquired company's key scientists quit. Technology transfer failed. Integration stalled.

We helped them step back and understand both organizations before making more changes. Through ONA, we identified what made each organization effective, where capabilities complemented each other, and how to integrate while preserving value. We designed integration that maintained the acquired team's scientific culture while building development discipline. We created clear boundaries between platform work and development work. We built collaboration mechanisms that respected different working styles.

**Measurable outcomes:** Key scientific talent retention improved from 44% to 91%, successful technology transfer completed 4 months ahead of revised timeline, first integrated program nominated for development 8 months after acquisition, integrated team published 3 high-impact papers (maintaining academic productivity while building commercial capability), acquisition achieved strategic objectives ahead of plan.

## Industry Context
*Current market dynamics and organizational pressures*

The managed services market tells a story of explosive growth masking organizational turbulence. The global market was valued at over $344 billion in 2024 and is projected to exceed $600 billion by 2030, with IT expected to lead at a compound annual growth rate of 13.1%. Managed services revenue specifically could rise 13% in 2025, driven by customer demand for cybersecurity, cloud services, AI solution consulting, and compliance services.

Here's what those growth numbers hide: 60% of organizations partnered with managed service providers because cybersecurity was their top challenge, but 85% of those MSPs face "significant challenges" maintaining compliance for customers. The market is growing faster than many providers can build the organizational capabilities to deliver on their promises.

The ongoing talent crisis hit IT services particularly hard. 48% of tech leaders cite recruiting qualified talent as a major problem, and IT departments are notoriously difficult to recruit and retain talent for. When smaller providers finally hire experienced people, those employees gain specialized experience and move to larger companies with bigger budgets. The talent treadmill never stops.

Meanwhile, the industry faces a fundamental shift in service delivery expectations. AI will become increasingly embedded in the core of managed services, with the industry moving from reactive problem-fixing to "predict, prevent and optimize." But only a fraction of providers have built the organizational capabilities to deliver predictive services at scale.

Canalys forecasts overall channel growth will hit 9% in 2025, while managed services revenue could rise 13%. That gap represents opportunity—but only for organizations that can build delivery capabilities faster than their competitors.

## Common Operational Challenges
*The daily realities IT service leaders face*

IT services companies live in permanent controlled chaos. Your service desk is handling 400 tickets. Your senior engineers are firefighting at three different client sites. Your sales team just closed a deal requiring capabilities you don't quite have yet. And your largest client just asked if you can help them with AI implementation, which wasn't in the original scope.

The MSP market is expected to reach almost $350 billion globally by 2024 and soar to over $1 trillion by 2033, but half of MSPs and MSSPs use spreadsheets to track customer compliance. That's not a technology problem—that's an organizational maturity problem.

Your delivery teams are structured around traditional service lines—network management, security, cloud. But your clients don't think in service lines. They think in business outcomes. So every client engagement requires coordination across multiple internal teams that don't naturally work together, using processes designed for simpler service models.

Cybersecurity remains a top priority, with 60% of respondents saying it's what led them to partner with an MSP. But 93% of security leaders expect to face daily AI-driven attacks in 2025. Your security team is trying to stay ahead of threats that evolve daily, while simultaneously managing client expectations, maintaining certifications, and training new team members who've never done security work before.

The talent challenge cuts both ways. You can't find experienced people, so you hire promising generalists and train them. By the time they're productive, they're marketable, and larger firms recruit them away. You're effectively running a training program for your competitors while trying to grow your own business.

Large enterprises account for 60% of the total managed IT services share, and over 70% of large enterprises globally are expected to adopt hybrid cloud solutions by 2025, with managed services playing a central role in managing these environments. That's massive opportunity—if you can build the organizational capability to deliver at enterprise scale.

## Where Executives Get Stuck
*The gaps between strategy and execution*

IT services executives know exactly what they need to do. Expand service offerings. Improve delivery efficiency. Build AI capabilities. Increase automation. Scale operations. The strategy is clear. The execution is where things fall apart.

Take automation. Leadership knows that predictive AI can identify potential bottlenecks in development processes, error patterns, and code changes that might impact unexpected areas of software. The technology exists. But implementing it requires restructuring how your service teams work, retraining engineers who've done reactive support for their entire careers, redesigning client communication patterns, and fundamentally changing your pricing models.

Most IT services firms try to bolt AI onto existing delivery models. They buy tools, do some training, and expect transformation. Six months later, utilization is at 30% and your best engineers have reverted to doing things the old way because the new way requires coordination with teams that don't align on priorities.

Or consider expanding service offerings. Your clients want comprehensive solutions—security, cloud, compliance, AI consulting. But your organization is structured around specialization. Your security team and cloud team barely talk to each other. Your compliance people and your technical delivery people operate in completely different worlds. Attempting cross-sells without organizational integration just creates more coordination overhead and client confusion.

The challenge intensifies with acquisitions. Private equity loosened its purse strings following a year of political and economic turmoil, and 2025 is likely to see high levels of acquisitions. But integrating acquired service providers requires aligning completely different operational cultures, standardizing delivery approaches, combining toolsets, and somehow retaining the key people who made the acquired company valuable in the first place.

The gap between strategy and execution shows up predictably:

First, delivery teams can't maintain quality while scaling. You add clients faster than you can hire and train people. Quality slips. Client satisfaction drops. Churn increases.

Second, service standardization conflicts with client customization. You build standard delivery processes to achieve efficiency, but every client wants customization. Your teams revert to one-off solutions, eliminating the efficiency gains.

Third, senior technical people become bottlenecks. Your best engineers are the ones clients want on their accounts. They're spread across too many engagements, become overwhelmed, and either burn out or leave for less demanding roles.

## How Rooted Helps IT Services Leaders
*Organizational strategy that actually works in service delivery environments*

We don't come in with playbooks about service delivery frameworks or ITSM implementations. We help you understand how your organization actually delivers services, where the bottlenecks are, and how to build organizational capabilities that allow you to scale without sacrificing quality.

**Organizational Network Analysis for IT Services**

In IT services companies, the real delivery organization bears little resemblance to the org chart. You've got informal coordination networks that make client delivery work. Senior engineers who mentor junior team members in ways that never show up in any process documentation. Client relationships that depend on specific people, creating key person dependencies that constrain your growth.

Our ONA maps those invisible structures. We'll show you that your top three engineers are involved in 80% of complex troubleshooting across all clients, creating bottlenecks that slow delivery. We'll show you that your service desk team has developed workarounds for your official processes because the official processes don't actually work with real client situations. We'll show you exactly where knowledge transfer breaks down and why your newer engineers can't deliver at the level your clients expect.

We worked with a mid-market MSP struggling with delivery consistency. Same services, wildly different outcomes across clients. Leadership assumed it was a training problem. Our ONA revealed the actual issue: delivery quality correlated almost perfectly with which senior engineer was assigned to the account. Those engineers had developed their own delivery approaches over years, but there was no systematic way to transfer their knowledge. We didn't just create training programs—we extracted the implicit frameworks those engineers used, formalized them, and built knowledge transfer systems that worked in the chaos of service delivery.

**Change Management in Service Organizations**

IT services companies change constantly. New service offerings. New client requirements. New tools and platforms. New compliance requirements. Most service leaders assume their teams handle change well because the industry demands constant adaptation.

But here's what we see: your teams are excellent at tactical adaptation—learning new tools, handling new client requests, adjusting to changing requirements. They're terrible at strategic organizational change—shifting service delivery models, changing how teams collaborate, adopting new governance approaches.

Our OCM work distinguishes between tactical and strategic change. When you're rolling out predictive maintenance services powered by AI, the technical training is the easy part. The hard part is changing how your service teams interact with clients—from reactive problem-solving to proactive optimization. That requires changing deeply ingrained behaviors, redefining success metrics, and restructuring client communication patterns.

An MSP implementing AI-powered predictive services found their engineers resisting the change. Not because they couldn't learn the technology, but because their entire professional identity was built around being heroic problem-solvers who fixed things when they broke. Shifting to preventing problems before they occurred felt like diminishing their value. We didn't just train them on the technology—we helped them reframe their professional identity around optimization rather than heroics. Adoption went from 35% to 89% in 90 days.

**Business Process Engineering for Service Delivery**

Service delivery processes in most IT services firms are a patchwork. You've got the official process documented in your service catalog. Then you've got the actual process your teams use, which includes 47 workarounds and depends on Jim in network operations remembering to check something that's not in any documentation.

Our BPE work doesn't just document processes—it redesigns them to account for organizational reality. When we map your service delivery lifecycle, we're looking at the official process, the actual process, where they diverge, and why. Usually the divergence exists because the official process assumes information availability or coordination capabilities that don't actually exist in your organizational structure.

A managed security services provider had a perfectly documented incident response process. In practice, their response time varied by 400% depending on which team caught the alert. Our BPE analysis revealed the problem: effective response required coordination across three teams that had no regular communication channels and used different tools. We didn't just redesign the process—we restructured the team interfaces so the right people were naturally connected at the right times.

**Organizational Development & Effectiveness**

The IT services industry faces a continuous capability development challenge. You need to constantly upskill your teams in new technologies while simultaneously developing the business skills to deliver effective client services. Most MSPs approach this ad hoc—sending people to vendor training, hoping they learn, and being frustrated when capabilities don't transfer.

Our OD&E work builds systematic capability development. We help you identify the specific capabilities your organization needs to deliver your service portfolio, map current capability gaps, and create development approaches that work with the realities of service delivery.

You can't pull engineers off client work for week-long training sessions. So we design learning that happens in the flow of work. We identify your internal experts and help them become better at knowledge transfer. We create structured mentorship programs that work across distributed delivery teams. We build learning systems that capture tribal knowledge and make it accessible when people need it.

A growing MSP needed to develop cloud migration capabilities across their engineering team. Traditional training would have taken team members off client work for multiple weeks and cost over $200K. Instead, we identified their three best cloud architects, helped them document their decision frameworks, built structured shadowing programs, and created reference materials that captured their expertise. Development cost: $60K. Time to capability: 4 months instead of 12. And they built internal capability to continue developing expertise as technologies evolved.

## Why Mid-Market IT Services Leaders Work With Rooted
*What makes us different from the Big 5*

The large consultancies will sell you a service transformation program with methodology frameworks, maturity models, and an implementation timeline that extends beyond your planning horizon. They'll bring in people who've studied IT services but never actually delivered services or managed a help desk at 2 AM when a client's infrastructure is down.

We're different. Our team includes people who've actually run service delivery organizations, managed distributed technical teams, and dealt with the reality of maintaining service quality while scaling rapidly. We understand the difference between what works in theory and what works when you've got 15 client escalations, a staffing shortage, and a P1 incident at your largest account.

We focus on mid-market IT services because that's where organizational strategy creates competitive advantage. Large service providers can absorb inefficiency through scale. Small providers are nimble enough that everyone knows everything. Mid-market providers have real organizational complexity but need solutions that work within realistic resource constraints.

Our engagements deliver measurable improvements in months, not years. We work with your actual delivery constraints—we're not going to tell you to pause client work for organizational transformation. And we build your internal capability to continue improving after we leave.

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value
*Real situations where organizational strategy makes the difference*

**Scenario 1: Scaling Managed Security Services Without Adding Headcount Proportionally**

A managed security services provider had 40 SOC analysts handling 24/7 monitoring for 85 clients. They needed to grow to 150 clients but couldn't find qualified analysts. Their options appeared to be: limit growth, accept service quality decline, or somehow find 60 more analysts in a market where they couldn't find 6.

Through ONA, we discovered that 12 of their 40 analysts were handling 70% of the complex investigations and escalations. The other 28 were doing initial triage and routine monitoring but constantly pulling senior analysts into situations they should have been able to handle themselves.

The problem wasn't that junior analysts were bad—it was that knowledge transfer was completely informal. Senior analysts helped when asked but had no structured way to transfer their decision-making frameworks.

We redesigned their organizational structure to formalize knowledge transfer. We documented the decision frameworks senior analysts used for common scenarios. We created structured learning paths with milestone-based progression. We implemented a buddy system that paired new analysts with experienced ones systematically rather than randomly. Most importantly, we changed how they measured success—from individual ticket resolution to team capability development.

**Measurable outcomes:** Grew from 85 to 142 clients with only 12 additional hires (versus 60 planned), average resolution time decreased by 31%, escalation rate decreased from 34% to 14%, junior analyst productivity reached senior analyst levels in 5 months instead of 18 months, senior analyst satisfaction improved from 6.1 to 8.4 (out of 10) because they spent less time firefighting.

**Scenario 2: Post-Acquisition Integration of Competing MSPs**

An MSP backed by private equity acquired a regional competitor to expand geographic coverage and service capabilities. The strategic rationale was sound—combined capabilities, expanded client base, operational efficiencies. The integration was a disaster.

Both companies provided similar services but had completely different operational approaches. The acquiring company was process-driven with standardized delivery frameworks. The acquired company was relationship-driven with highly customized client delivery. When the acquiring company tried to standardize service delivery, the acquired company's best technicians quit and their largest clients threatened to churn.

We helped them step back and actually understand both organizational cultures before making more changes. Through ONA, we mapped how each organization delivered value. The acquiring company's strength was operational efficiency and scalability. The acquired company's strength was deep client relationships and rapid customization.

Instead of forcing convergence, we designed a hybrid model. We standardized operational infrastructure—tools, platforms, security frameworks—which drove efficiency without impacting client relationships. But we kept delivery approaches flexible, allowing client-facing teams to maintain their relationship-driven approach while operating on a common platform.

**Measurable outcomes:** Key talent retention improved from 58% to 87%, client retention from acquired company reached 94% (versus projected 70%), operational efficiency gains of 26% achieved through infrastructure standardization, cross-selling between client bases increased by 180%, integration completed 4 months ahead of revised timeline.

**Scenario 3: Transitioning from Reactive to Predictive Service Delivery**

A network managed services provider wanted to shift from break-fix to predictive maintenance. They invested in AI-powered monitoring tools that could predict network issues before they impacted clients. The technology worked. Adoption didn't.

Six months after implementation, only 30% of client accounts were using predictive services. Engineers were still operating reactively. Clients were still calling with problems that the monitoring system had predicted days earlier but nobody had acted on.

The problem wasn't the technology—it was organizational. The entire service delivery model was built around responding to client issues. Success was measured by ticket resolution time. Engineer performance was evaluated on problem-solving speed. The monitoring tools generated predictions, but there was no organizational process for acting on those predictions, no way to communicate proactively with clients, and no incentive structure that rewarded preventing problems.

We redesigned the service delivery organization around predictive maintenance. We restructured teams to include proactive monitoring roles. We created communication frameworks for client engagement before problems occurred. We changed success metrics from resolution speed to issue prevention. We developed training that helped engineers reframe their role from firefighter to optimizer.

Most importantly, we addressed the professional identity challenge. Many engineers felt their value came from solving difficult problems—preventing problems felt less valuable. We helped them understand that the complexity was shifting from reactive troubleshooting to predictive analysis, which actually required more sophisticated skills.

**Measurable outcomes:** Predictive service adoption increased from 30% to 84% of clients, unplanned downtime across client base decreased by 68%, client satisfaction scores increased from 7.2 to 9.1 (out of 10), engineer retention improved from 78% to 91% (because less firefighting reduced burnout), predictive services achieved 23% higher margins than reactive services.

**Scenario 4: Building AI Consulting Capabilities in Traditional MSP**

An established MSP with strong infrastructure and security practices saw massive client demand for AI consulting. Leadership decided to build AI advisory capabilities. They hired 6 AI consultants, created an AI services group, and expected to start generating revenue.

Twelve months later, they'd closed 3 small engagements and lost $600K. The AI consultants were frustrated. The sales team didn't understand how to sell AI services. The delivery teams couldn't support AI implementations. Clients were confused about what the MSP actually offered.

The problem was organizational. They'd tried to add AI as a separate capability instead of integrating it into their existing organizational structure. The AI consultants operated in isolation, using different methodologies, different tools, and different client engagement approaches than the rest of the organization. When they needed infrastructure or security support, coordination was painful. When sales tried to cross-sell, clients didn't understand how AI services related to the infrastructure management they were already buying.

We helped them integrate AI capabilities organizationally. We created cross-functional delivery teams that paired AI consultants with infrastructure and security specialists. We developed integrated service offerings that combined AI consulting with implementation support. We built knowledge transfer programs so traditional delivery teams understood AI well enough to identify opportunities.

Most critically, we didn't treat this as building a new business unit—we treated it as developing a new organizational capability that enhanced their existing services.

**Measurable outcomes:** AI consulting revenue increased from $180K to $2.4M in 18 months, AI service attachment rate to existing clients increased from 4% to 37%, client satisfaction with AI services improved from 5.8 to 8.9 (out of 10), AI consultant retention improved from 50% to 100%, traditional delivery team members successfully delivered AI-enhanced services without dedicated AI consultants.

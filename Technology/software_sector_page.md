## Industry Context
*Current market dynamics and organizational pressures*

The software industry looks healthier on paper than it feels in practice. Global IT spending is projected to grow by 9.3% in 2025, with software segments expected to grow at double-digit rates. Worldwide spending on AI is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 29% from 2024 to 2028. Yet 62% of software developers say they use AI code generators, and 55% of tech leaders view incorporating AI as their biggest business challenge.

That's not a technology problem—it's an organizational one.

The software industry spent 2024 navigating layoffs while simultaneously facing critical skill shortages in AI and cybersecurity. The hardest-to-fill technical jobs of 2024—software developer, data analyst, web designer—didn't even make the top three in 2025. Now companies need AI engineers (28% of demand), IT security engineers (16%), and cybersecurity engineers (13%). Your entire hiring strategy just became obsolete, and your organizational structure probably did too.

Meanwhile, 48% of tech leaders cite recruiting qualified talent as a major problem, even as the ongoing talent crisis intensifies. Companies experienced robust growth in 2024, with 80% increasing revenue, 67% expanding staff, and 82% taking on new projects. But that growth is creating organizational complexity faster than most leadership teams can manage it.

More than half of respondents expect skill gaps and training needs to pose significant obstacles to achieving their top three strategic priorities. Here's the reality: your development teams are being asked to integrate AI, improve security, manage cloud migrations, and ship features faster—all while the tools they use change every six months and half their colleagues are new to the team.

## Common Operational Challenges
*The daily realities software leaders face*

Software companies operate in a permanent state of controlled chaos. That's not a bug, it's a feature—rapid change is baked into the industry. But there's a difference between productive chaos and destructive chaos, and most software organizations are closer to the destructive end than they'd like to admit.

Tech leaders identify the biggest software development challenges as security (51%) and data privacy (41%), along with AI deployment (44%) and the quality and reliability of AI code (45%). But here's what those statistics miss: these aren't separate problems. They're interconnected organizational challenges that require coordinated responses across multiple teams.

Your security team implements new protocols. Your development team finds them too restrictive and works around them. Your compliance team doesn't know the workarounds exist until you're in the middle of an audit. Your customer success team is promising features that would violate your new security standards, but nobody told them about the constraints.

That's the software organization reality. You've got brilliant people working incredibly hard, but they're working in organizational structures designed for a different era. Your engineering teams are distributed across three time zones. Your product team operates on quarterly roadmaps while your biggest customer wants changes next week. Your QA processes were designed for waterfall development, but you've been running agile for three years.

Developers are losing 23% of their time to technical debt and significant portions to fragmented information, forcing them to hunt for documentation instead of writing code. Translation: your most expensive talent is spending a quarter of their time cleaning up organizational messes instead of creating value.

## Where Executives Get Stuck
*The gaps between strategy and execution*

Software executives understand their strategic imperatives. Integrate AI. Improve security posture. Accelerate delivery. Improve quality. Scale the organization. Every board deck has the same priorities.

Here's where it falls apart: nobody can agree on what "integrate AI" actually means. Your CTO wants to use AI for code generation. Your CPO wants AI features in the product. Your COO wants AI to optimize operations. Each initiative requires different teams, different skills, and different organizational structures. And they're all competing for the same limited pool of AI talent.

Or take security. Leadership announces that security is now everyone's responsibility. Great. What does that actually mean for the junior developer writing authentication code? What does it mean for the product manager prioritizing the backlog? What does it mean for the DevOps engineer managing deployments? Without clear organizational structures that define roles, responsibilities, and decision rights, "security is everyone's responsibility" becomes "security is nobody's responsibility."

Only 51.6% of manufacturers indicated they have a corporate AI strategy in 2024. But having a strategy document isn't the problem—it's creating the organizational capability to execute that strategy. Most software companies we meet have multiple conflicting AI initiatives across different parts of the organization, each with its own governance, its own priorities, and its own definitions of success.

The gap between strategy and execution in software companies usually shows up in three places:

First, decision-making breaks down. Nobody knows who's actually authorized to make which decisions. Teams either wait for approval and ship late, or move fast and create conflicts that require expensive rework.

Second, knowledge doesn't flow. Your best architects know things that your development teams need, but there's no systematic way to transfer that knowledge. Your customer success team has insights about product-market fit that your product team never hears.

Third, organizational structure creates bottlenecks. You've got cross-functional teams in theory, but departmental reporting structures in practice. People say yes in planning meetings, then go back to their departments and discover their actual priorities are completely different.

## How Rooted Helps Software Leaders
*Organizational strategy that actually works in development environments*

We work differently than other consultancies because we actually understand software organizations. We're not going to tell you to implement SAFe or adopt a new methodology or restructure around business units. We're going to help you understand how your organization actually functions, then design interventions that work with your reality.

**Organizational Network Analysis for Software**

In software companies, the org chart is fiction. The real organization is defined by who talks to whom, who makes decisions, who has the knowledge that others need, and who influences without authority.

Our ONA work maps those informal structures. We'll show you that your principal engineer who's supposedly "too technical" to be in leadership is actually making architectural decisions for three different teams. We'll show you that your product managers are getting requirements from seven different sources with no clear prioritization framework. We'll show you exactly where information flow breaks down and why your best people are frustrated.

We worked with a SaaS company struggling with feature delivery speed. Leadership kept pushing for faster releases. Engineering kept missing deadlines. Our ONA revealed that every feature required sign-off from nine different people across four departments, but there was no clear sequence for those approvals. Features weren't late because developers were slow—they were late because half the approval time was spent waiting for the right people to be available. We redesigned their decision architecture, clarified approval authority, and cut feature delivery time by 35% without changing a single technical process.

**Change Management in Software Development**

Software companies are constantly changing. New frameworks. New tools. New processes. New organizational structures. Most software leaders assume their teams are good at change because the industry changes so fast. They're wrong.

What software teams are good at is technical change—adopting new tools, learning new languages, implementing new architectures. What they're terrible at is organizational change—shifting how teams collaborate, changing reporting structures, adopting new governance models.

Our OCM approach recognizes that distinction. We help you design change programs that account for software culture. We identify your technical influencers—the developers other developers listen to—and work through them. We create feedback mechanisms that work with agile cadences. We design adoption strategies that respect developer autonomy while driving organizational alignment.

A fintech software company needed to implement new security review processes across 40 development teams. Traditional change management would have meant training sessions, policy documents, and enforcement. We took a different approach. We identified the tech leads who had the most influence across teams, worked with them to pilot the new process, let them provide feedback that actually shaped the final approach, and then had them champion it to their peers. Adoption rate: 92% within 60 days. Compliance violations: down 84%.

**Business Process Engineering for Software Operations**

Software development processes are supposed to be lightweight and adaptive. So why do most software companies have heavyweight, rigid processes that nobody actually follows?

Because someone designed a process without understanding the organizational dynamics that would make it work. Or because a process that worked for 20 people doesn't work for 200. Or because the process assumes information is available that actually requires three meetings and two approvals to access.

Our BPE work doesn't just redesign processes—it redesigns the organizational relationships that make processes function. When we map your software development lifecycle, we're not just looking at the steps. We're looking at who needs to communicate, what information needs to flow where, what decisions need to be made at what points, and what organizational structures either enable or prevent those things from happening.

A B2B software company had sprint planning processes that consumed 20% of their development time. Our BPE analysis revealed the real problem: their product backlog structure required information from five different stakeholders, but there was no regular forum where those stakeholders aligned. Teams spent the first day of every sprint just trying to clarify requirements. We restructured their product organization to create regular alignment points upstream of sprint planning. Sprint planning time: cut to 8% of development time. Feature clarity at sprint start: improved from 62% to 91%.

**Organizational Development & Effectiveness**

The software industry has a dirty secret: most technical skills development is completely ad hoc. Developers learn through Stack Overflow and side projects. Architects emerge organically. Product managers figure it out as they go.

That works fine until you need to scale. Then you discover that your five best developers all learned different approaches and are teaching new team members contradictory patterns. Your architects are making decisions based on different principles. Your product managers use different frameworks for prioritization.

Our OD&E work builds systematic capability development. We help you identify the specific organizational capabilities you need—not just technical skills, but the softer capabilities that make cross-functional teams work: communication patterns, decision-making frameworks, conflict resolution approaches.

We worked with a software company scaling from 50 to 200 engineers. Instead of just hiring and hoping, we designed a capability development program that started with their existing senior engineers. We helped them articulate their implicit decision-making frameworks, then built structured programs to transfer those frameworks to newer engineers. We created mentorship structures that worked with distributed teams. We designed learning approaches that happened in the flow of work, not in separate training sessions.

Result: their time-to-productivity for new engineers decreased from 6 months to 10 weeks. Their architectural consistency—measured by code review cycles—improved by 45%. And their senior engineers reported spending less time on mentorship because it was more structured and effective.

## Why Mid-Market Software Leaders Work With Rooted
*What makes us different from the Big 5*

The large consultancies will sell you a digital transformation program with a hundred acronyms and a implementation timeline measured in years. They'll bring in people who've read case studies about software companies but have never actually shipped code or managed a development team.

We're different. Our team includes people who've actually led software organizations, managed distributed engineering teams, and dealt with the realities of trying to scale from 20 developers to 200. We understand the difference between theory and practice, between what works in a slide deck and what works when the production system goes down.

We focus on the mid-market because that's where organizational strategy matters most. Large enterprises have enough resources to absorb organizational inefficiency. Startups are small enough that everyone knows what everyone else is doing. Mid-market software companies have real organizational complexity but need solutions that actually work within their constraints.

Our engagements are measured in months, not years. We deliver measurable improvements to organizational effectiveness, not frameworks that require dedicated PMOs to implement. And we build your internal capability to continue the work after we leave.

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value
*Real situations where organizational strategy makes the difference*

**Scenario 1: Scaling Development Organization Through Hypergrowth**

A B2B SaaS company grew from 60 to 180 developers in 18 months, fueled by a successful Series B. Revenue was growing 300% year-over-year. Morale was collapsing. Delivery velocity was decreasing despite tripling headcount.

Leadership couldn't figure out why. They'd implemented all the right frameworks—agile ceremonies, product trio, continuous deployment. But sprint velocity was down 40% per engineer. Feature delivery was taking longer. Quality was declining.

Our ONA revealed the problem: they'd added people faster than they could integrate them into the organization. New developers didn't know who to ask for help. Informal knowledge networks that worked at 60 people collapsed at 180. Decision-making authority was unclear, so teams waited for approval or made contradictory decisions that required rework.

We didn't tell them to slow hiring—they couldn't, given their growth trajectory. Instead, we redesigned their organizational structure to formalize the informal networks that had worked at smaller scale. We created explicit knowledge transfer programs. We clarified decision rights at different levels. We built communication structures that worked at their current scale.

**Measurable outcomes:** Per-engineer productivity returned to previous levels within 5 months (representing 67% improvement), feature delivery time decreased by 43%, onboarding time for new developers decreased from 4 months to 6 weeks, employee satisfaction scores improved from 6.2 to 8.1 (out of 10).

**Scenario 2: Implementing Security-First Development Culture**

A fintech software company faced increasing regulatory scrutiny and customer security requirements. Leadership mandated security-first development practices. Six months later, security vulnerabilities per release had barely changed. Security reviews were bottlenecking releases. Developers viewed security as "compliance theater."

The problem wasn't that developers didn't care about security—it was that the organizational structure made secure development nearly impossible. Security reviews happened at the end of the development cycle when changes were expensive. Developers had no direct access to security expertise. Security requirements were documented in a portal nobody read. The security team was viewed as gatekeepers, not partners.

Through ONA, we mapped the actual relationship between development and security teams. Then we redesigned it. We embedded security engineers into development teams. We moved security reviews earlier in the development cycle. We created feedback loops so developers could learn security principles in context. Most importantly, we changed how security expertise was shared—from a centralized review process to a distributed coaching model.

**Measurable outcomes:** Security vulnerabilities in production decreased by 78%, security review bottlenecks decreased by 62%, time from security issue identification to remediation decreased from 12 days to 2.5 days, developer satisfaction with security process increased from 3.1 to 7.8 (out of 10), zero additional security headcount required.

**Scenario 3: Post-Acquisition Product and Team Integration**

A cloud infrastructure software company acquired a complementary DevOps tool company. The strategic rationale was perfect—integrated product offering, expanded customer base, combined technical capabilities. The integration was a mess.

The acquiring company tried to immediately integrate the products and consolidate engineering teams. The acquired company's best engineers quit. Customers of the acquired product threatened to churn. Integration timelines slipped by six months.

The problem wasn't technical—both teams were competent. The problem was organizational. The companies had completely different development cultures, different decision-making processes, different approaches to product management. The acquiring company assumed their processes were better and tried to impose them. The acquired team resisted.

We helped them step back and understand both organizations through ONA before making any more changes. We identified which processes absolutely needed to align and which could remain different. We designed an integration approach that preserved what made the acquired company valuable—their speed and customer intimacy—while gaining benefits of combined operations.

Most importantly, we redesigned the product organization to create clear accountability without forcing artificial integration. Both product lines kept separate teams but shared architecture and infrastructure. We created intentional collaboration points instead of forcing constant coordination.

**Measurable outcomes:** Key technical talent retention improved from 52% to 86%, integrated product features shipped within 3 months of revised timeline, customer churn from acquired product decreased from 18% to 4%, cross-team collaboration (measured by pull requests and shared sprints) increased by 220%.

**Scenario 4: Implementing AI Development Capabilities**

A software company with 150 developers needed to integrate AI capabilities into their core product. They hired 8 AI/ML engineers, gave them 3 months to deliver a proof of concept, and expected magic.

Nine months later, they had technically impressive models that couldn't be integrated into the existing product. The AI team was isolated from the core engineering team. Product managers didn't know how to specify AI features. QA didn't know how to test AI systems. DevOps couldn't reliably deploy models. Customer success couldn't explain AI capabilities to customers.

The problem wasn't the AI engineers—they were excellent. The problem was organizational. The company tried to add AI as a separate function instead of building AI capability into their existing organizational structure.

We helped them redesign the organization to integrate AI capability. We created cross-functional AI product teams that included traditional engineers, AI specialists, product managers, and QA. We built knowledge transfer programs so non-AI engineers understood AI capabilities and constraints. We developed shared language and frameworks so product managers could specify AI features effectively.

Most importantly, we didn't treat this as a technical initiative—we treated it as an organizational capability development program.

**Measurable outcomes:** Time from AI model development to production integration decreased from 6 months to 3 weeks, number of teams successfully deploying AI features increased from 1 to 7, AI-related customer support tickets decreased by 65% (due to better feature design), non-AI engineers' understanding of AI capabilities improved from 2.1 to 7.3 (out of 10, self-assessed), AI engineer retention improved from 63% to 91%.

## Industry Context
*Current market dynamics and organizational pressures*

The hardware manufacturing sector finds itself at a turning point. Global computer hardware manufacturing revenue reached an estimated $227.6 billion in 2025, though the industry has experienced a decline at a compound annual growth rate of 3.2% over the past five years. But the real story isn't in the numbers—it's in the organizational chaos those numbers create.

Federal Reserve rate cuts in September and November 2024 offered some relief, with industry experts predicting recovery in early 2025. Yet hardware companies face a convergence of pressures that would make even the most seasoned executive reach for the aspirin bottle. Currently announced tariffs are expected to impact the cost of goods sold by an average of 7% across the technology hardware ecosystem, forcing companies to completely rethink their operational models.

The percentage of supply chains serving the US and located in North and South America is expected to grow from 59% to 69% over the next two years, with Mexico the top beneficiary. This isn't just a logistics shift—it's an organizational earthquake that requires complete realignment of teams, processes, and operational structures.

Meanwhile, the Employment Cost Index for total compensation in manufacturing has continued to climb in 2024, gaining 3.8% year over year as of September. Add in a Deloitte and Manufacturing Institute study showing that 1.9 million manufacturing jobs could go unfilled over the next 10 years if talent challenges aren't addressed, and you've got a workforce crisis that can't be solved by simply raising salaries.

## Common Operational Challenges
*The daily realities hardware leaders face*

Hardware manufacturers operate in a world where every decision cascades through interconnected systems. Your supply chain team makes a sourcing change, and suddenly your quality assurance process falls apart. Your engineering team adopts a new design protocol, and your production floor grinds to a halt. 

Supply chain disruptions affect 35% of critical hardware components, causing delays and higher operational costs. But here's what the statistics miss: it's not just about the components. It's about the 47 people across six departments who need to coordinate differently when those components arrive late. It's about the production manager who's been doing things one way for 15 years suddenly needing to adapt to nearshored suppliers with different quality standards.

More than half of midsize manufacturers say preparing for a technology-driven future is critical for the industry, with more than half prioritizing tech integration for competitive advantage. Translation: your teams are being asked to adopt new technologies while simultaneously maintaining production quotas, managing quality standards, and somehow finding time to get trained on systems that didn't exist six months ago.

The manufacturing floor tells the real story. You've got veteran operators who can troubleshoot a production line in their sleep working alongside new hires who've never touched the equipment. You've got engineering teams designing products for automated assembly while your plant managers are still figuring out how to integrate the automation equipment you bought last year.

## Where Executives Get Stuck
*The gaps between strategy and execution*

Here's where it gets interesting. Most hardware executives we meet have brilliant strategies. They know exactly what needs to happen: nearshore production, integrate AI into quality control, upskill the workforce, improve cross-functional collaboration. The strategy deck looks perfect.

Then they try to execute, and the wheels come off.

The engineering team makes design changes that the production team can't implement with current equipment. The procurement team sources new suppliers to manage tariff exposure, but nobody bothered to map out how those changes affect the 23 other processes downstream. Leadership announces a new initiative, and middle managers nod their heads in the meeting, then go back to their teams and have no idea how to actually make it happen.

Companies that can weather uncertainty while capitalizing on opportunities like Apple's embrace of AI in hardware—where 17% of PCs shipped worldwide in 2024 were AI-capable, with 54% being Apple machines—will become industry leaders. But here's what that statistic doesn't tell you: Apple didn't just decide to do AI. They had to completely realign their product development teams, retrain their engineers, restructure their supplier relationships, and fundamentally change how different parts of their organization communicate.

The gap isn't in knowing what to do. It's in having the organizational infrastructure to actually do it. Most hardware companies have org charts that made sense five years ago but create bottlenecks today. They have informal communication patterns that work great—until they don't. They have processes that were designed for a different era serving a different customer base with different expectations.

## How Rooted Helps Hardware Leaders
*Organizational strategy that actually works in production environments*

We don't show up with a playbook. We show up with Organizational Network Analysis that maps how your organization actually works—not how the org chart says it should work. We've found that in most hardware companies, about 30% of critical decisions are being made by people who aren't even in the room when those decisions get discussed at the leadership level.

**Organizational Network Analysis for Hardware**

ONA reveals the hidden structure of your organization. That supply chain manager everyone goes to when there's a problem? Our analysis will show you exactly why—and more importantly, what happens to your organization if that person leaves. Those silos between engineering and production that everyone complains about? We'll show you the exact points where communication breaks down and give you specific interventions to fix it.

We worked with a mid-market computer peripheral manufacturer dealing with nearshoring challenges. Their org chart showed clear lines of authority. Our ONA revealed that decisions were actually being made through informal networks that cut across three different divisions. Once they understood the real decision-making structure, they could design an organizational approach that worked with their actual communication patterns instead of fighting against them.

**Change Management in Hardware Production**

Sustainability is core to companies like Tetra Pak's strategy, aiming to drive circular solutions by designing recyclable packaging, using recycled materials, reducing waste, and extending equipment lifetime. But implementing that kind of transformation requires changing how dozens of people work every single day.

Our OCM approach doesn't just train people on new processes. We identify the informal leaders on your production floor—the people others actually listen to—and work through them to drive adoption. We map resistance patterns before they become problems. We create feedback loops so you know what's working and what's not before small issues become big failures.

For a hardware manufacturer implementing new quality control systems, we didn't start with training manuals. We started by identifying the 12 people across their organization who had the most influence over how others adopted new processes. We worked with those people first, turned them into champions, and let them drive adoption naturally through existing communication channels. Implementation time: cut by 40%. Adoption rate: 94% within six months.

**Business Process Engineering for Manufacturing**

Average lead times for production materials have shown significant improvement since their peak in 2022 but remain stubbornly higher than pre-pandemic levels. That's a process problem that requires process solutions—but not the kind that ignore organizational reality.

We map your current processes end-to-end, find the bottlenecks that org charts miss, and design new workflows that account for how your people actually work. When we reengineer a process, we're also redesigning the organizational relationships that make that process function.

A hardware component manufacturer had material planning processes that looked efficient on paper but created constant firefighting in practice. Our BPE work revealed that the process required information sharing across four departments that had no natural communication channels. We didn't just fix the process—we restructured team responsibilities so the right people were naturally connected to the right information at the right time.

**Organizational Development & Effectiveness**

Roles that require higher-level skills are projected to grow the fastest between 2022 and 2032, with a combination of technical manufacturing, digital, and soft skills required. But you can't just send people to training and hope for the best.

Our OD&E work builds organizational capability systematically. We help you identify the specific capabilities your organization needs, map your current capability gaps, and create development approaches that build skills in context. We don't pull people off the floor for week-long training sessions—we design learning that happens in the flow of work.

For a hardware manufacturer transitioning to Industry 4.0 technologies, we created a capability development program that started with their informal technical experts. We helped those experts become better at sharing knowledge, then built structured mentorship programs around them. Within 18 months, they had increased their internal technical capability by 60% without hiring a single new person.

## Why Mid-Market Hardware Leaders Work With Rooted
*What makes us different from the Big 5*

The large consultancies will sell you a two-year transformation program with 47 work streams and a PMO that costs more than your annual IT budget. They'll fly in partners who've never stepped foot on a production floor and junior consultants who wouldn't know a PCB from a PBX.

We work differently. Our team includes people who've actually managed manufacturing operations, led engineering teams, and dealt with the realities of hardware production. We know the difference between designing a beautiful process map and implementing something that works when the production line goes down at 2 AM.

We work at the mid-market level because that's where organizational strategy matters most. Large enterprises can throw resources at problems. Startups are small enough to stay nimble. Mid-market hardware companies are big enough to have real organizational complexity but need solutions that actually fit their budget and their reality.

Our engagements are measured in months, not years. We deliver specific, measurable improvements to organizational effectiveness—not 300-page decks that sit on shelves. And we work ourselves out of a job. Our goal is to build your internal capability to manage organizational effectiveness, not create dependency on external consultants.

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value
*Real situations where organizational strategy makes the difference*

**Scenario 1: Nearshoring Production While Maintaining Quality**

A computer accessories manufacturer needed to shift 40% of production from Asia to Mexico within 18 months to manage tariff exposure and reduce lead times. The technical aspects—finding suppliers, qualifying parts, setting up logistics—were straightforward. The organizational aspects were a nightmare.

Their quality assurance team had developed deep relationships with Asian suppliers over 15 years. Their production planning team had processes built around 90-day lead times. Their engineering team designed products assuming certain manufacturing capabilities that the new suppliers didn't have.

We mapped the organizational relationships that made their current production work, identified which ones needed to be recreated with new suppliers and which ones needed to change entirely, and designed a transition plan that accounted for actual human relationships, not just supply chain theory.

**Measurable outcomes:** Production transition completed in 16 months (two months ahead of schedule), quality incident rate remained flat during transition (industry average: 40% increase during nearshoring), employee turnover in affected departments: 3% (industry average during major transitions: 22%).

**Scenario 2: Integrating AI-Powered Quality Control**

A hardware manufacturer implemented computer vision systems for automated quality inspection. The technology worked perfectly in testing. In production, adoption was stuck at 30% six months after launch. Production supervisors kept reverting to manual inspection.

We conducted ONA to understand why. Turned out the supervisors who were slowest to adopt were the ones other supervisors looked to for guidance. And they were slow to adopt because the implementation team had never explained how the AI system made decisions—so they didn't trust it.

We didn't retrain everyone. We brought in the informal leaders, walked them through the AI decision-making process in detail, let them test edge cases until they understood its limitations, and turned them into advocates. Within 90 days, adoption hit 87%.

**Measurable outcomes:** AI quality control adoption increased from 30% to 87% in 90 days, quality escape rate decreased by 31%, inspection time per unit decreased by 52%, manual quality inspector roles successfully transitioned to quality analyst positions (zero involuntary terminations).

**Scenario 3: Scaling Production with Limited Workforce Growth**

A PC component manufacturer needed to increase production by 35% but faced labor shortages and couldn't find qualified workers. Simply adding more people wasn't an option, even if they could find them.

Through ONA, we identified that 15% of their workforce was spending 40% of their time on coordination activities that added no value. We redesigned workflows to eliminate unnecessary handoffs, restructured teams to reduce coordination overhead, and redeployed that time to value-adding activities.

Then we used OD&E to identify their internal technical experts and built structured knowledge transfer programs around them. Instead of hiring 30 new production workers, they made their existing 100 workers 35% more productive.

**Measurable outcomes:** Production increased 37% with workforce growth of only 8% (versus planned 30%), overtime hours decreased by 22% despite increased production, internal promotion rate increased from 8% to 23%, time-to-productivity for new hires decreased from 6 months to 3.5 months.

**Scenario 4: Post-Acquisition Integration**

A mid-market hardware manufacturer acquired a smaller competitor to gain access to their specialized manufacturing capabilities and customer base. The deal made perfect strategic sense. The integration was a disaster.

The acquired company had a completely different culture—more informal, faster decision-making, less documentation. The acquiring company tried to implement their processes immediately. Within three months, they'd lost 40% of the key technical staff from the acquired company.

We helped them understand the organizational dynamics of both companies through ONA, identified which processes absolutely needed to align and which ones could remain different, and created an integration approach that preserved what made the acquired company valuable while gaining the efficiencies of combined operations.

**Measurable outcomes:** Key talent retention improved from 60% to 89%, cross-company collaboration increased by 340% (measured by project participation), combined operational efficiency reached targets 7 months ahead of plan, customer satisfaction scores for acquired company's customers remained stable (industry average: 30% decline during acquisition integration).

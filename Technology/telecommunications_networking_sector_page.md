## Industry Context
*Current market dynamics and organizational pressures*

The telecommunications industry stands at a critical juncture where massive infrastructure investments meet uncertain returns. As of March 2024, only 49 out of 585 operators had deployed or launched 5G standalone networks, which offer full 5G capabilities but require significant financial commitment. Deloitte predicts fewer than 20 additional 5G SA networks will come online by 2025, as current 4G and 5G non-standalone networks meet most application needs.

Here's the reality behind those numbers: telecoms are caught between needing to invest billions in infrastructure and struggling to generate returns that justify those investments. Network-as-a-service business models have 92% of telco CEOs viewing them as critical growth drivers, with the market predicted to reach $6.7 billion by 2028. But realizing these ambitions is hampered by heavy reliance on intermediaries and challenges in B2B service delivery.

The industry witnessed major disruptions in 2024. A massive AT&T disruption in February affected at least 70,000 customers. After Hurricane Helene in October, over 100,000 Verizon customers experienced service interruptions. Workforce reductions for all three major carriers from as far back as 2022 slowed response times during outages and took a toll on quality of service. Verizon laid off 4,800 employees with $1.9 billion in severance. T-Mobile let go of 5,000 employees in 2023. AT&T cut 6,300 jobs in 2023 after eliminating 39,700 in 2022.

These workforce reductions create organizational challenges that financial statements don't capture. When you cut thousands of experienced employees, you don't just reduce headcount—you lose institutional knowledge, disrupt informal coordination networks, and create gaps in organizational capability that take years to rebuild. Then when networks fail and you need those people to fix things, they're gone.

Meanwhile, people in the US consumed a record-breaking 100 trillion megabytes of wireless data in 2023, a 36% year-over-year increase. Spectrum shortages amid rising data use create operational pressure. Cybersecurity threats escalate—telecom networks represent critical infrastructure subject to cyberattacks from hostile nations and cybercrime syndicates. As cyberattacks multiply, telecoms' increasingly complex digital environments, multiplying access points, and growing stores of customer data make them more vulnerable than ever.

## Common Operational Challenges
*The daily realities telecom leaders face*

Telecom companies operate massive infrastructure networks that require continuous coordination across engineering, operations, customer service, sales, and countless other functions. You've got network operations centers monitoring infrastructure 24/7. You've got field technicians deploying and maintaining equipment. You've got customer service handling millions of interactions. You've got enterprise sales teams selling complex solutions. And you've got to coordinate all of this across geographic regions, regulatory environments, and organizational silos that have existed for decades.

Telco leaders expect to face a widening range of regulatory and policy issues, with growing impact from emerging domains like AI regulation and digital markets. Further challenges include network supplier regulation, which is both in flux and inconsistent between countries. Spectrum sharing rules are being proposed and updated in various countries while regulations on pricing are expanding in scope. Navigating this regulatory complexity requires organizational capabilities most telecoms haven't systematically developed.

High interest rates, cautious investor sentiment, and heightened scrutiny over capital expenditures create significant financial pressure. With limited ability to increase pricing, companies must optimize every dollar spent on network expansion and upgrades while ensuring faster returns on investment. But optimizing spending requires organizational visibility and coordination that legacy telecom structures often lack.

Senior industry executives' people priorities are headed by talent, skills, and culture. When asked to rank inhibitors of transformation, they put poor internal collaboration and missing skills second and third respectively, behind lack of budget. The sector's relatively high degree of remote working poses particular challenges to collaboration and upskilling. Meanwhile, 85% of telco employees believe HR functions will require major or moderate change over the next five years.

The dominant telecom service providers have largely ceded leadership in R&D to equipment makers, software companies, and cloud providers. This creates organizational challenges around technology adoption, vendor management, and maintaining technical expertise internally. When you're dependent on external vendors for innovation, you need organizational capabilities to effectively partner with, integrate, and manage those external relationships. Most telecoms struggle with this.

The shift from 5G to 6G means the customer base expands beyond consumers and businesses to devices and hyperlinked networks in energy grids and supply chains. This creates external dependencies for security risks. More telcos are considering zero-trust models requiring continuous verification of user identities and device security. But implementing zero-trust isn't a technology project—it's an organizational transformation that touches every part of the operation.

## Where Executives Get Stuck
*The gaps between strategy and execution*

Telecom executives understand their strategic imperatives. Deploy 5G infrastructure. Prepare for 6G. Integrate AI capabilities. Improve cybersecurity. Expand enterprise services. Optimize operational efficiency. The strategies are clear. The execution is where everything falls apart.

Take AI integration. Leadership knows AI is expected to dominate transformation in years to come, with current priorities on process automation and software-based networks. But implementing AI requires more than deploying technology. It requires restructuring how operations teams work, redefining roles and responsibilities, building new skill sets, changing decision-making processes, and fundamentally altering organizational dynamics that have existed for decades.

Or consider network-as-a-service models. The strategy makes perfect sense—transform from selling connectivity to selling outcomes. But executing requires organizational transformation. Sales teams need to sell differently. Engineering teams need to design solutions differently. Operations teams need to deliver and monitor services differently. Finance teams need to structure pricing differently. Customer success teams need to manage relationships differently. Each of these changes is difficult. Coordinating all of them simultaneously across a large, siloed organization is nearly impossible without systematic organizational strategy.

The challenge intensifies with fiber optic deals representing the largest subsector share (11.3%) of all closed M&A infrastructure deal activity during 2024. This market is capital-intensive and increasingly viewed as an emerging asset class by PE and infrastructure investors. But successful M&A in telecom requires integrating not just infrastructure but organizational cultures, operational processes, customer relationships, and technical capabilities. Most telecoms approach M&A as an asset acquisition when it's actually an organizational integration challenge.

The gap between strategy and execution shows up predictably:

First, technology initiatives fail because organizational readiness lags. You deploy new network capabilities, but operations teams don't know how to manage them. You roll out new enterprise services, but sales teams can't effectively sell them. You implement automation, but the workflow designs assume human intervention that no longer exists.

Second, cross-functional initiatives get stuck in silos. You launch a transformation program that requires engineering, operations, customer service, and sales to work together. Each function optimizes for its own goals. Nobody has accountability for the end-to-end outcome. The initiative fragments and fails.

Third, change happens too slowly. Telecom organizations are large and complex with deeply embedded ways of working. Even when leadership mandates change, it takes years to actually shift organizational behavior. Meanwhile, technology and competitive dynamics move faster, creating a widening gap between what the organization can do and what the market requires.

## How Rooted Helps Telecom & Networking Leaders
*Organizational strategy that works in complex, regulated environments*

We don't arrive with frameworks about organizational transformation or digital operating models. We come with approaches that work in large, complex, regulated environments where you can't just blow everything up and start over.

**Organizational Network Analysis for Telecommunications**

In telecom companies, understanding actual organizational dynamics is critical because the org chart bears little resemblance to how work actually gets done. You've got matrix management, geographic structures, functional silos, and countless informal coordination mechanisms that make everything work.

Our ONA maps the real organization. We'll show you that your "cross-functional collaboration" actually depends on six specific people who've become critical coordination nodes. We'll show you where information flow breaks down between engineering and operations. We'll show you which informal networks are critical to service delivery and what happens if key people leave.

We worked with a regional telecom provider struggling with 5G deployment coordination. The deployment required alignment across network engineering, field operations, IT systems, customer service, and regulatory compliance. On paper, they had governance structures and coordination mechanisms. In practice, deployment was months behind schedule and teams were constantly firefighting. Our ONA revealed that actual coordination happened through informal relationships between mid-level managers, but those managers had no authority to make cross-functional decisions. We redesigned coordination structures to formalize decision-making authority and create systematic alignment mechanisms. Deployment timelines improved by 34% without adding headcount.

**Change Management in Telecom Operations**

Telecom companies face continuous change—new technologies, new regulations, new competitive dynamics, new service models. Most telecom leaders assume their organizations handle change well because the industry changes constantly. They're wrong.

Telecom organizations are good at technical change—deploying new network equipment, implementing new systems, adopting new technologies. They're terrible at organizational change—shifting how different functions collaborate, changing decision-making models, adopting new operational approaches.

Our OCM work addresses this distinction. When you're moving from reactive network operations to AI-powered predictive maintenance, the technology shift is straightforward. The organizational change is complex. Operations teams need to work differently. Maintenance crews need new skills and different workflows. Customer service needs to communicate proactively instead of reactively. Success metrics need to change. The entire operational model needs transformation.

A national wireless carrier implemented AI-powered network optimization but saw minimal benefit. The technology worked perfectly in testing. In production, network operations teams continued managing networks manually. The problem wasn't the AI—it was change management. Operations teams didn't trust automated decisions, didn't understand how the AI worked, and reverted to familiar manual processes whenever issues emerged. We designed a change approach that built trust through transparency, developed skills through hands-on experience, and created adoption incentives aligned with team goals. AI utilization increased from 22% to 87% in six months.

**Business Process Engineering for Network Operations**

Telecom operations involve countless interconnected processes—network planning, deployment, maintenance, monitoring, incident response, customer provisioning, service assurance, and more. Most of these processes evolved over decades, were designed for different technologies and different competitive environments, and create friction when you try to operate modern networks using legacy processes.

Our BPE work redesigns operations to work with current and future needs while accounting for organizational realities. When we map your network operations, we're not just documenting steps. We're identifying where handoffs create delays, where information doesn't flow, where decisions get stuck, where organizational structures create bottlenecks, and where process redesign can improve outcomes.

A fiber provider had service provisioning that took 45-90 days for enterprise customers. Competitors were provisioning in 15-20 days. Leadership demanded faster provisioning but didn't understand why it took so long. Our BPE analysis revealed the problem: provisioning required 23 handoffs across 11 different teams, each optimizing for their own metrics. Nobody owned the end-to-end customer experience. We didn't just redesign the process—we restructured team accountabilities to create end-to-end ownership, simplified handoffs, and eliminated unnecessary approval steps. Provisioning time decreased to 12-18 days without adding resources.

**Organizational Development & Effectiveness**

The telecom industry faces a critical capability development challenge. You need technical expertise in emerging technologies, operational excellence in service delivery, commercial capabilities for new business models, and regulatory competence for complex compliance environments. Building these capabilities while simultaneously running massive operations requires systematic organizational development that most telecoms haven't implemented.

Our OD&E work creates capability development approaches that work at scale. We help you identify critical capabilities, assess current capability levels, design development programs that build skills in the flow of work, and create systems that continuously develop organizational capability.

A wireline provider needed to develop fiber installation and maintenance capabilities as they transitioned from copper to fiber networks. Traditional training would have meant classroom sessions pulling technicians off the field for weeks. Instead, we identified their most skilled fiber technicians, documented their expertise, built role-based learning paths, created on-the-job training approaches, and designed certification programs that validated capability. Time to fiber proficiency decreased from 18 months to 6 months. Service quality improved. Customer satisfaction increased.

## Why Mid-Market Telecom Leaders Work With Rooted
*What makes us different from the Big 5*

The large consultancies will sell you multi-year transformation programs with elaborate frameworks, maturity models, and hundreds of work streams. They'll bring in people who understand theory but haven't actually managed telecom operations or dealt with the realities of regulated infrastructure businesses.

We're different. Our team includes people who've actually worked in telecom operations, managed network deployments, and dealt with the complexities of large-scale service delivery. We understand the difference between consulting frameworks and operational reality.

We focus on mid-market telecom because that's where organizational strategy creates competitive advantage. Large national carriers have resources to absorb inefficiency. Small regional players can stay nimble. Mid-market telecom companies face real complexity but need solutions that deliver value within realistic resource constraints.

Our engagements are measured in months, not years. We deliver specific improvements to organizational effectiveness, not roadmaps requiring dedicated transformation teams to implement. And we build internal capability to sustain improvements after we leave.

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value
*Real situations where organizational strategy makes the difference*

**Scenario 1: Accelerating 5G Deployment Through Organizational Redesign**

A regional telecom provider needed to deploy 5G across their coverage area within 24 months to remain competitive. They'd invested heavily in spectrum and equipment. Deployment was stuck. Engineering planned routes. Operations deployed infrastructure. IT configured systems. Customer service prepared for launch. But coordination was a disaster. Deployment was 40% behind schedule after 8 months.

Leadership kept pushing for faster execution. Teams kept working harder. Progress remained slow. The problem wasn't effort—it was organizational design. Each function optimized for its own goals without visibility into other functions' constraints. Planning happened sequentially when it needed to happen concurrently. Decision-making authority was unclear, so decisions escalated and stalled.

Through ONA, we mapped actual coordination patterns and identified bottlenecks. We redesigned organizational structures to create end-to-end deployment ownership. We established concurrent planning processes. We clarified decision authority at different levels. We created visibility mechanisms so all functions could see constraints and adjust accordingly. We built coordination rhythms that worked with operational realities.

**Measurable outcomes:** 5G deployment accelerated by 67%, completed network rollout 2 months ahead of revised schedule, deployment cost per site decreased by 23%, cross-functional coordination time decreased by 52%, employee satisfaction with deployment process improved from 4.3 to 8.1 (out of 10).

**Scenario 2: Building Enterprise Services Capabilities**

A wireless carrier identified enterprise services as a growth opportunity but struggled to compete with established providers. They had infrastructure capabilities but lacked enterprise sales, solution design, and account management expertise. They tried hiring experienced enterprise team members from competitors. Those hires failed—they couldn't operate effectively in an organization designed for consumer services.

The problem wasn't the people—it was organizational design. The company's processes, systems, incentives, and culture were all optimized for consumer mass market, not enterprise B2B. Sales cycles were different. Solution complexity was different. Customer relationship models were different. Support requirements were different.

We helped them build enterprise capabilities organizationally. We didn't just hire enterprise people—we created organizational structures that enabled them to succeed. We designed sales processes for longer cycles. We built solution design capabilities. We created account management models. We aligned incentives with B2B economics. We developed support structures for complex implementations.

Most importantly, we didn't try to bolt enterprise capabilities onto consumer organization. We created dedicated enterprise organizational structures that could operate differently while connecting to shared infrastructure.

**Measurable outcomes:** Enterprise revenue increased from $45M to $180M in 24 months, enterprise win rate improved from 18% to 43%, average deal size increased from $150K to $420K, enterprise customer satisfaction reached 8.6 (out of 10), enterprise sales cycle decreased from 9 months to 5.5 months.

**Scenario 3: Post-Acquisition Integration of Regional Fiber Provider**

A mid-market telecom acquired a regional fiber provider to expand coverage and capabilities. The strategic logic was sound—complementary geographies, technology integration opportunities, revenue synergies. The integration was painful. Network integration took 18 months instead of 9. Customer churn reached 22%. Key technical staff departed. Synergies failed to materialize.

The acquiring company tried to immediately impose their systems and processes on the acquired company. They assumed their way was better and forced standardization. The acquired company's employees resisted. Customers were confused. Operations suffered.

We helped them step back and actually understand both organizations before making more changes. Through ONA, we identified what made each organization effective, where capabilities complemented each other, and how to integrate while preserving value. We designed integration that maintained the acquired company's customer intimacy while gaining operational efficiencies. We created clear migration paths for systems and processes. We clarified decision authority during transition. We built cultural bridges between organizations.

**Measurable outcomes:** Key talent retention improved from 62% to 89%, customer churn from acquired company decreased from 22% to 7%, network integration completed on revised timeline, operational synergies achieved $12M versus projected $18M but customer revenue synergies exceeded projections by $9M, integrated employee satisfaction reached 7.8 (out of 10) within 18 months.

**Scenario 4: Building Operational Resilience and Reliability**

A regional telecom faced increasing outage frequency and duration. Network reliability had been a competitive advantage. Over three years, as they grew and added complexity, reliability declined. Major outages increased from 2 per year to 11. Average restoration time increased from 2.3 hours to 6.7 hours. Customer satisfaction dropped from 8.9 to 6.8 (out of 10).

Leadership invested in redundancy and monitoring technology. Reliability didn't improve. The problem wasn't technical—it was organizational. As the company grew, coordination between engineering, operations, and field service fragmented. Incident response processes designed for smaller scale created bottlenecks at larger scale. Knowledge about network dependencies was stuck in individual heads. Decision-making during incidents was unclear.

We redesigned their operational model for resilience. We created integrated incident response teams with clear leadership. We built systematic approaches to capturing and sharing network knowledge. We designed escalation processes that worked at scale. We established communication protocols for customer-impacting events. We created learning systems so every incident improved future response.

Most importantly, we shifted from viewing outages as individual incidents to building organizational capability for continuous resilience.

**Measurable outcomes:** Major outages decreased from 11 per year to 3 per year, average restoration time decreased from 6.7 hours to 1.8 hours, customer satisfaction recovered to 8.6 (out of 10), employee confidence in incident response improved from 5.2 to 8.9 (out of 10), regulatory compliance incidents related to outages decreased from 7 to zero.

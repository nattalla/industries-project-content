# Internet & Digital Services - Rooted Advisory Group

## Industry Context
*Current market dynamics and organizational pressures*

The internet and digital services industry is experiencing what industry analysts might call "interesting times"—which in business speak means organized chaos with a side of existential questions. Citi Research analysts note that online already accounts for 70-75%+ of ad budgets overall, with growing engagement and newer online ad formats like retail media and video leading to improved conversion rates. The market looks healthy on paper.

But here's what the growth statistics hide: companies experienced cost pressures throughout 2024, completing reduction-in-force initiatives (RIFs) in late 2022 and throughout 2023 across most of the coverage universe. Now they're focused on core projects and 2024 was the first year in which most companies delivered a more normalized cost structure. Translation: they cut deep, refocused, and are finally figuring out how to operate efficiently again.

The digital services space faces a unique challenge—regulatory risk is likely to persist in 2024 across large-cap internet companies in both the U.S. and Europe. Google and Amazon each face antitrust suits, the FTC is seeking to modify Meta's consent order, and established regulatory domains are evolving in new ways. Navigating compliance while maintaining innovation velocity requires organizational structures that most digital services companies haven't built yet.

Meanwhile, global IT spending is projected to reach $1.5 trillion in 2024 with an 8.7% growth rate, but spending patterns have fundamentally changed. Companies are no longer throwing money at every digital initiative—they're demanding ROI, clear business value, and operational efficiency. The era of "move fast and break things" has given way to "move deliberately and actually deliver value."

The GenAI agent revolution is improving engagement, customer service, and conversions. According to industry research, AI assistants and chatbots can proliferate across B2B and B2C channels. But implementing these capabilities requires more than just deploying technology—it requires organizational transformation that most digital services companies are still figuring out.

## Common Operational Challenges
*The daily realities digital services leaders face*

Digital services companies operate at the intersection of technology innovation and customer expectations, which means they're constantly being squeezed from both sides. Your engineering team wants to rebuild the entire platform using the latest framework. Your product team wants features shipped yesterday. Your operations team is drowning in customer support tickets. And your leadership team wants to know why operational costs keep increasing despite all the automation you've supposedly implemented.

Better customer experience is a key focus and major challenge for every digital services company. To meet ever-evolving customer preferences and expectations, companies must improve digital interaction platforms and work toward robust infrastructure. But here's the problem: every department has a different definition of what "better customer experience" means, and nobody's aligned on how to measure it.

Cybersecurity issues create constant pressure. Data breaches due to malware attacks threaten organizational setups, and preventing data breaches is a key challenge. But security implementations slow down development velocity, create friction in user experiences, and require coordination across teams that don't naturally work together. Your security team implements new protocols. Your developers find them too restrictive and create workarounds. Your customers get frustrated by additional authentication steps. Balancing security with usability while maintaining development speed is an organizational challenge, not a technical one.

The shift to remote and hybrid work has reshaped business operations worldwide. Tools that enhance productivity and enable companies to build global teams help businesses access talent across borders. But managing distributed teams across time zones while maintaining culture, collaboration, and knowledge transfer requires organizational capabilities that most companies haven't systematically developed.

eCommerce is gaining share of overall retail transactions with social commerce emerging as a trend. The GenAI agent revolution is expected to improve engagement, commerce, and customer service significantly. But capitalizing on these trends requires cross-functional coordination between technology, operations, marketing, and customer service teams—and most digital services companies have organizational structures that create silos instead of enabling collaboration.

## Where Executives Get Stuck
*The gaps between strategy and execution*

Digital services executives know exactly what they need to do. Improve customer experience. Scale infrastructure. Integrate AI. Enhance security. Expand internationally. The strategic priorities are clear. Where they get stuck is in the execution—specifically, in building the organizational capabilities required to execute effectively.

Take AI integration. Every digital services company knows they need to deploy AI capabilities. But what does that actually mean organizationally? Do you build an AI team? Do you distribute AI expertise across product teams? How do you upskill existing teams? How do you change decision-making processes to account for AI-generated insights? How do you redesign customer touchpoints when AI capabilities shift what's possible?

Most companies try to bolt AI onto existing organizational structures and processes. They hire data scientists, give them some projects, and expect transformation. Six months later, the data scientists have built some models that nobody's using, the product teams don't know how to integrate AI capabilities, and leadership is wondering why they're not seeing ROI.

Or consider scaling challenges. Digital services companies grow rapidly—sometimes too rapidly. You go from 50 employees to 500 in two years. Your informal communication patterns that worked perfectly at 50 people completely break down at 500. Decision-making slows to a crawl because nobody knows who's authorized to make what decisions. Knowledge that was in people's heads needs to be systematized but nobody has time to do it. New employees take months to become productive because onboarding is still whatever the first 50 people figured out organically.

The gap between strategy and execution shows up predictably. First, strategic initiatives get stuck in execution limbo. Leadership announces priorities, everyone nods, then goes back to their teams and discovers that actually implementing those priorities conflicts with fifteen other things they're already doing. Second, different parts of the organization optimize for different goals without any shared framework. Engineering optimizes for technical excellence, product optimizes for feature velocity, operations optimizes for efficiency, and nobody realizes they're creating contradictory requirements until everything starts breaking. Third, scaling problems emerge faster than organizational capability develops. You triple in size but your organizational maturity doesn't triple—it barely increases—and suddenly you're a 500-person company with startup-level organizational capability.

## How Rooted Helps Internet & Digital Services Leaders
*Organizational strategy that works in high-velocity environments*

We don't show up with frameworks about agile transformation or digital operating models. We show up with Organizational Network Analysis that reveals how your organization actually functions—who makes decisions, where information flows, where bottlenecks exist, and which informal networks make everything work.

**Organizational Network Analysis for Digital Services**

In digital services companies, the formal organization chart is particularly useless. You've got matrix management, cross-functional teams, agile pods, and about seventeen different ways people actually get work done. Understanding what's really happening requires mapping the actual organizational dynamics.

Our ONA reveals the real structure. We'll show you that your "decentralized" decision-making is actually super-centralized around four specific people who've become bottlenecks. We'll show you that the product manager everyone thinks is struggling is actually the critical coordination node holding three initiatives together. We'll show you exactly where information flow breaks down and why your brilliant remote work policy is failing.

We worked with a SaaS platform company struggling with delivery speed despite doubling their engineering team. Leadership couldn't understand why more engineers meant slower delivery. Our ONA revealed that their architecture decisions required coordination across five different teams, but there was no dedicated person or process for that coordination. Features weren't late because engineers were slow—they were late because coordinating those five teams consumed 60% of everyone's time. We redesigned their organizational structure to create clear coordination responsibilities and accountability. Feature delivery speed increased by 42% with the same headcount.

**Change Management in Digital Services**

Digital services companies change constantly. New features. New technologies. New competitors. New market dynamics. Most digital services leaders assume their organizations are good at change because they work in a fast-changing industry. They're wrong.

Organizations are excellent at tactical change—adopting new tools, building new features, responding to market shifts. They're terrible at strategic change—fundamentally shifting how teams collaborate, changing decision-making models, adopting new service delivery approaches.

Our OCM work recognizes that distinction. When you're shifting from a monolithic platform to microservices architecture, the technology migration is straightforward. The organizational change is complex. Development teams need to work differently. Ownership models need to change. Coordination mechanisms need to be redesigned. Quality assurance processes need to adapt. Operations teams need new capabilities.

A digital marketplace company needed to implement new compliance requirements across their entire platform. Traditional change management would have meant training sessions, policy updates, and enforcement. We took a different approach. We mapped which developers had the most influence across teams, worked with them to prototype compliant approaches, let them shape the implementation requirements, and had them champion adoption to peers. Compliance adoption reached 94% within 45 days without a single enforcement action.

**Business Process Engineering for Digital Operations**

Digital services companies are supposed to be efficient. Software scales infinitely, automation eliminates manual work, and everything moves at internet speed. So why do most digital services operations feel like barely controlled chaos?

Because processes designed for 50 people don't work for 500. Because somebody implemented a solution three years ago that made sense then but creates friction now. Because every team optimized their own processes without considering downstream impacts.

Our BPE work doesn't just redesign processes—it redesigns the organizational dynamics that make processes work. When we map your customer onboarding flow, we're not just documenting steps. We're identifying where information needs to flow between teams, what decisions need to be made at what points, what organizational capabilities enable efficient execution, and what structural issues create inefficiency.

A streaming services platform had customer activation processes that looked efficient on paper but had a 47% drop-off rate. Our BPE analysis revealed the real problem: activation required customers to complete steps that spanned three different systems, each managed by different teams who had never actually talked to each other about the end-to-end experience. We didn't just fix the process—we restructured team accountabilities so customer activation became a shared responsibility with clear ownership. Drop-off decreased to 18% and activation time decreased by 61%.

**Organizational Development & Effectiveness**

Digital services companies face continuous capability development challenges. New technologies emerge constantly. Customer expectations evolve. Competitive dynamics shift. Market conditions change. Most companies approach capability development reactively—hiring when they discover skill gaps, sending people to training when problems emerge, hoping teams figure things out.

Our OD&E work builds systematic capability development. We help you identify the specific organizational capabilities you need, map current capability gaps, understand how capabilities need to evolve as you scale, and create development approaches that work with high-velocity environments.

A digital advertising platform needed to develop advanced analytics capabilities across their account management team. Traditional training would have meant pulling people off client work for courses. Instead, we identified their best analysts, documented their decision frameworks, built role-based learning paths that happened in the flow of work, created peer learning structures that worked with distributed teams, and designed progression milestones that clarified capability expectations.

Result: time to analytical proficiency for new account managers decreased from 9 months to 11 weeks. Client retention improved by 23% because account managers could provide better strategic guidance. And senior analysts spent less time answering basic questions because the capability development system answered them systematically.

## Why Mid-Market Digital Services Leaders Work With Rooted
*What makes us different from the Big 5*

The large consultancies will sell you a digital transformation program with fancy frameworks, maturity models, and implementation timelines that extend beyond your planning horizon. They'll bring in people who've studied digital businesses but have never actually scaled a SaaS platform or managed a marketplace operation.

We're different. Our team includes people who've actually led digital services organizations, scaled platforms, and dealt with the realities of hypergrowth. We understand the difference between what works in a case study and what works when you've got three production incidents, a major customer escalation, and a product launch happening simultaneously.

We focus on mid-market digital services because that's where organizational strategy creates competitive advantage. Large platforms have resources to absorb inefficiency. Early-stage startups are small enough that everyone knows everything. Mid-market digital services companies have real organizational complexity but need solutions that work within realistic constraints.

Our engagements deliver measurable improvements in months, not years. We don't implement heavyweight PMO structures or require dedicated transformation teams. We work with your existing structure, build your internal capability, and get out of the way once you can sustain the improvements yourself.

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value
*Real situations where organizational strategy makes the difference*

**Scenario 1: Scaling Platform Operations During Hypergrowth**

An e-commerce marketplace grew from 100K to 1M active users in 18 months. Revenue was exploding. So were operational costs, customer complaints, and employee burnout. Customer satisfaction scores dropped from 8.7 to 6.2. Support response times tripled. Platform reliability declined.

Leadership couldn't understand why scaling was so painful. They'd invested heavily in infrastructure. They'd hired aggressively. They'd implemented industry best practices. But operational performance kept declining.

Our ONA revealed the real problem: they'd scaled headcount but not organizational capability. Their customer support team had grown from 8 to 60 people, but they still operated like an 8-person team. Knowledge was stuck in the heads of the original team members. New support agents took 4 months to become productive. Nobody knew who was supposed to make which decisions. Escalation paths were completely informal.

We didn't just redesign processes—we redesigned the organizational structure. We created tiered support roles with clear capabilities at each tier. We extracted knowledge from experienced agents and systematized it. We built structured onboarding that got new agents productive in 6 weeks instead of 4 months. We clarified decision rights so agents could resolve issues without constant escalation.

**Measurable outcomes:** Customer satisfaction recovered to 8.4 within 5 months, support response time decreased by 52%, new agent time-to-productivity decreased from 4 months to 6 weeks, operational costs per transaction decreased by 31%, employee satisfaction improved from 5.9 to 8.1 (out of 10).

**Scenario 2: Integrating AI Capabilities Into Digital Services**

A content streaming platform decided to implement AI-powered recommendation systems and personalization features. They hired ML engineers, bought tooling, ran pilots. The technology worked. Adoption didn't.

Product managers didn't know how to design features around AI capabilities. Engineers couldn't effectively integrate ML models into the platform. Operations teams didn't know how to monitor AI system performance. Customer success teams couldn't explain AI features to clients.

The problem wasn't the AI—it was organizational readiness. They'd treated AI as a technical implementation when it required organizational transformation.

We helped them build AI capability organizationally. We created cross-functional AI implementation teams that included ML engineers, product managers, platform engineers, and operations. We designed communication frameworks so product managers could effectively specify AI feature requirements. We built knowledge transfer programs so platform engineers understood ML model requirements. We developed monitoring approaches that operations teams could actually use.

Most importantly, we didn't create an AI team—we distributed AI capability across the organization so it became a core competency rather than a separate function.

**Measurable outcomes:** AI feature implementation time decreased from 6 months to 8 weeks, product manager confidence in designing AI features improved from 3.1 to 8.4 (self-assessed, out of 10), platform engineers successfully integrated ML models without ML engineer involvement in 73% of cases, customer adoption of AI features increased from 12% to 61%.

**Scenario 3: Managing International Expansion**

A digital services company expanded from US-only to operating in 12 countries across 4 continents in 24 months. The business case was strong. The execution was a disaster.

Each country operation developed its own processes. Product features worked differently in different markets. Customer support operated inconsistently. Engineering teams couldn't effectively collaborate across time zones. Leadership had no visibility into what was actually happening in different markets.

The problem was organizational design. They'd approached international expansion as geographic distribution when it required organizational redesign for global operations.

Through ONA, we mapped how work actually flowed across their distributed organization. We identified which processes needed global consistency and which needed local flexibility. We designed decision frameworks that clarified what got decided globally versus locally. We created communication structures that worked across time zones. We built knowledge-sharing mechanisms so innovations in one market could benefit others.

We didn't force standardization—we created organizational structures that enabled both global efficiency and local responsiveness.

**Measurable outcomes:** Time to launch new market decreased from 9 months to 3.5 months, operational efficiency across markets improved by 34%, cross-market feature adoption increased by 180%, engineering team collaboration (measured by code contributions across regions) increased by 240%, market-specific customer satisfaction maintained at 8+ (out of 10) across all regions.

**Scenario 4: Post-Acquisition Integration of Competing Platforms**

A mid-market video conferencing platform acquired a smaller but technologically advanced competitor. The strategic rationale was perfect—combined technology, expanded customer base, elimination of competitive threat. The integration failed spectacularly.

They tried to immediately integrate the platforms and consolidate teams. The acquired company's best engineers quit. Their innovative features broke during integration. Customers from both platforms threatened to churn. Integration timelines slipped by 11 months.

We helped them step back and understand both organizations before making more changes. Through ONA, we mapped the cultural differences, identified which capabilities made each platform valuable, and designed an integration approach that preserved what made both companies successful.

Instead of forcing immediate integration, we created federated teams that collaborated on shared services while maintaining separate platform teams. We identified which technologies were worth integrating and which should remain separate. We designed decision-making frameworks that worked with different organizational cultures. We built knowledge transfer programs that respected both companies' expertise.

**Measurable outcomes:** Key technical talent retention improved from 48% to 89%, integrated capabilities shipped 5 months ahead of revised timeline, customer churn from both platforms decreased to 2% (versus projected 25%), cross-platform feature adoption increased by 310%, combined platform achieved operational efficiency targets 8 months ahead of plan.

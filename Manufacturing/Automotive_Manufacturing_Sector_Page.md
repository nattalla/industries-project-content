# Automotive Manufacturing: Organizational Strategy for an Industry in Transition

## Industry Context
*Navigating the pivot from internal combustion to electric mobility while maintaining operational excellence*

The automotive manufacturing sector stands at a crossroads unlike any since Henry Ford's assembly line. Global vehicle sales hit 92.5 million units in 2024, but the real story isn't volume—it's the complete restructuring of how vehicles are designed, built, and sold. Electric vehicle sales reached 17 million units in 2024, representing over 20% of total car sales worldwide and growing at 25% annually. This isn't a trend. It's a transformation.

The numbers tell one story. The organizational reality tells another. EV production requires 30% fewer workers than traditional engine manufacturing, fundamentally altering workforce planning. Battery technology development demands entirely new skill sets in high-voltage safety, thermal management, and software integration. Supply chains built over decades for ICE vehicles are being dismantled and rebuilt around semiconductors, lithium, and rare earth minerals—often with 87-day lead times compared to pre-pandemic norms.

According to the 2024 AMS & ABB Automotive Manufacturing Outlook Survey, 36% of industry executives identify increased labor costs and skill deficiencies as their biggest challenge. Meanwhile, manufacturers face $95 billion in potential tariff impacts, supply chain disruptions affecting everything from casting forgings to microelectronics, and the pressure to maintain ICE profitability while investing billions in electrification infrastructure.

Here's what makes this challenging: automotive companies can't simply "switch" to EVs. They're running two manufacturing operations simultaneously—one profitable but sunset, one necessary but still margin-negative. Production delays persist throughout 2024. Model launches get postponed. And behind every delayed launch is an organization struggling to retrain engineers, reorganize production teams, and redefine decades-old processes.

## Common Operational Challenges
*The human and organizational costs of transformation*

**The Talent Paradox**
Every automotive executive knows they need EV expertise. Few know where to find it. Traditional automotive engineers spent careers mastering internal combustion optimization, transmission design, and exhaust systems. Those skills now have shrinking relevance. The new requirements—battery diagnostics, functional safety for autonomous systems, AI-driven quality control, cybersecurity architecture—require different knowledge bases. 

Companies face 58,000 direct job displacements in ICE-specific roles over the next five years, even as they struggle to fill new positions in electrification. The average automotive manufacturer has over 200 tier-1 suppliers and 12,000 tier-2 and tier-3 suppliers—all facing the same talent crunch. Small-to-medium suppliers with lower margins can't afford to retool production lines or compete for scarce talent.

**The Process Paradox**
Automotive companies are simultaneously optimizing existing ICE production (to fund the transition) while building entirely new EV processes. This isn't just adding a line. It's managing two different manufacturing philosophies under one roof. Battery assembly requires clean-room conditions. Software updates need cybersecurity protocols. Digital twin technology demands new data infrastructure.

Many manufacturers attempt this by copying existing organizational structures, creating parallel teams without addressing underlying workflow conflicts. Engineers trained on iterative physical prototypes struggle with software-defined vehicle development. Quality control teams accustomed to mechanical tolerances face new challenges in battery cell consistency and charging infrastructure integration.

**The Supply Chain Paradox**
Supply chains that took 50 years to optimize for ICE vehicles are being rebuilt in under a decade for EVs. The challenge isn't just sourcing new materials—it's coordinating thousands of suppliers through a transition they didn't plan for. A single semiconductor shortage can halt production across multiple models. Lithium and cobalt prices fluctuate wildly, making long-term planning nearly impossible.

The bigger problem is organizational: supply chain teams structured around stable, predictable sourcing relationships now need dynamic, multi-source strategies. Procurement teams that historically negotiated on volume now need to evaluate sustainability credentials, semiconductor allocation, and geopolitical risk. Most organizations haven't restructured their supply chain teams to match these new requirements.

## Where Executives Get Stuck
*The invisible organizational barriers to transformation*

Automotive executives aren't failing for lack of trying. They're getting stuck because transformation strategies treat organizational change as a project rather than a fundamental restructuring of how work gets done.

**Strategy Execution Gaps**
Senior leadership announces EV strategy. Engineering teams hear "build electric versions of current models." Supply chain hears "source batteries." Finance hears "manage declining ICE margins." HR hears "hire battery engineers." Nobody hears "reorganize how we collaborate across functions."

The result: siloed initiatives that don't connect. Engineering develops EV platforms without input from manufacturing on producibility. Supply chain commits to battery suppliers without engineering validation of specifications. Training programs teach new technical skills without addressing the cultural shift required for software-defined vehicles.

**Hidden Network Inefficiencies**
Here's what doesn't show up in org charts: the informal networks that actually get work done. In traditional automotive manufacturing, experienced engineers solve problems through relationships built over years. They know who has tribal knowledge about specific components, which supplier contacts can expedite orders, and how to navigate approval processes.

EV transition breaks these networks. New roles get created without connection to existing informal systems. Cross-functional teams form without understanding existing collaboration patterns. Knowledge holders retire without transferring critical institutional knowledge. The result is slower decision-making precisely when speed matters most.

**Change Fatigue and Resistance**
Workers who spent careers perfecting ICE assembly now face reassignment to battery production or job elimination. Middle managers who rose through traditional engineering paths see their expertise devalued. Suppliers who invested in ICE component manufacturing face obsolescence. This isn't resistance to change—it's rational response to existential disruption.

Most change management approaches address symptoms (provide training, communicate more) without addressing root causes (fundamental role redefinition, career path uncertainty, loss of identity). Workers aren't resisting EVs. They're resisting the organizational chaos accompanying the transition.

## How Rooted Helps Automotive Manufacturing Leaders
*A people-centered approach to technical transformation*

Rooted's work with automotive manufacturers starts from a different premise: technology transitions fail when organizations ignore the human systems that enable change. Our approach integrates four complementary services to address both technical and organizational transformation.

### Organizational Network Analysis: Mapping the Real Organization

Before restructuring teams for EV transition, automotive leaders need to understand how their current organization actually functions. ONA reveals the informal networks driving problem-solving, the knowledge brokers connecting silos, and the collaboration patterns that org charts miss.

In automotive manufacturing, ONA typically uncovers:
- **Cross-functional bottlenecks:** Engineers who become unintentional gatekeepers because everyone routes questions through them
- **Supplier relationship networks:** Informal connections that enable rapid problem-solving during supply chain disruptions
- **Knowledge silos:** Critical EV expertise concentrated in small teams without pathways for knowledge transfer
- **Cultural divides:** Disconnection between "legacy" ICE teams and "future" EV teams that undermines collaboration

One mid-market automotive supplier used ONA during EV component transition and discovered their most connected problem-solver was a senior technician, not an engineer. By formally integrating this person into the transition team and creating structured knowledge-sharing sessions, they reduced problem resolution time by 40% and improved cross-shift communication.

### Organizational Change Management: Building Change Capability

Automotive transformation requires sustained change over years, not months. Our OCM approach builds internal capacity for ongoing adaptation rather than managing discrete change events.

For automotive manufacturers, this means:
- **Stakeholder-specific change strategies:** Different approaches for engineers facing skill obsolescence versus suppliers navigating business model shifts
- **Communication architectures:** Information flows designed around how automotive teams actually collaborate, not idealized org charts
- **Resistance pattern identification:** Understanding whether resistance stems from capability gaps, cultural misalignment, or legitimate concerns about role elimination
- **Change champion networks:** Leveraging natural influencers identified through ONA to model new behaviors

A regional automotive components manufacturer facing EV transition used Rooted's OCM approach to identify and address three distinct employee groups: (1) senior engineers needing advanced technical reskilling, (2) mid-career workers requiring role redefinition support, and (3) entry-level hires needing integration into new team structures. Targeted interventions for each group resulted in 85% retention during the transition versus projected 60%.

### Business Process Engineering: Redesigning Work for Electric Manufacturing

EV production isn't just different equipment—it's different workflows, quality standards, and coordination requirements. Our BPE approach maps current-state processes, identifies inefficiencies, and redesigns workflows around new technical requirements while maintaining what works.

In automotive settings, BPE addresses:
- **Parallel production optimization:** Managing ICE and EV manufacturing on shared lines without cross-contamination
- **Supply chain workflow redesign:** New procurement processes for volatile battery materials versus stable ICE components
- **Quality control evolution:** Integrating software validation, battery safety testing, and traditional mechanical QA
- **Maintenance protocol development:** Predictive maintenance for digital manufacturing equipment versus reactive maintenance for legacy systems

A mid-size automotive manufacturer implementing battery pack assembly used Rooted's BPE methodology to redesign their quality control workflow. By mapping current inspection processes, identifying redundant steps, and integrating real-time sensor data, they reduced inspection time by 30% while improving defect detection rates. The key was involving line workers in process redesign rather than imposing top-down changes.

### Organizational Development & Effectiveness: Building Sustainable Capability

Technical skills training addresses knowledge gaps. OD&E builds the organizational capability to continuously adapt as technology evolves. For automotive manufacturers, this means developing leadership that can guide through uncertainty, teams that collaborate across traditional boundaries, and cultures that embrace experimentation.

Our OD&E work with automotive companies includes:
- **Leadership development for ambiguity:** Helping automotive executives lead through transformation when the destination keeps changing
- **Team effectiveness interventions:** Building cross-functional collaboration between traditionally siloed engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain teams
- **Culture assessment and evolution:** Identifying cultural elements that support innovation versus those reinforcing status quo
- **Performance management redesign:** Moving from metrics optimized for ICE efficiency to measures that support EV learning and adaptation

An automotive parts manufacturer used Rooted's OD&E approach during their transition to EV component production. Leadership assessments revealed managers strong in technical expertise but weak in change leadership. Rather than replace leaders, we developed a six-month coaching program focused on managing ambiguity, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and communicating during uncertainty. Post-program metrics showed 65% improvement in employee trust scores and 40% reduction in cross-functional project delays.

## Why Mid-Market Automotive Leaders Work With Rooted
*Access to transformation expertise without Big Five complexity*

Mid-market automotive manufacturers and suppliers face the same EV transformation pressures as major OEMs—but without the same resources. They can't afford 18-month McKinsey engagements or Accenture's full digital transformation stack. They need focused, practical interventions that deliver results.

Rooted provides:
- **Right-sized expertise:** We bring enterprise-level organizational strategy knowledge scaled for mid-market budgets and timelines
- **Integration versus isolation:** Our services work together rather than requiring separate contracts with different consultancies for change management, process improvement, and organizational development
- **Pragmatic implementation:** We focus on sustainable changes that work within existing constraints rather than idealized solutions requiring massive investment
- **Capability building:** We train your teams rather than creating dependency on external consultants

The difference shows up in how we structure engagements. Instead of comprehensive transformation programs, we start with targeted interventions where organizational issues are creating bottlenecks—then expand based on results. A supplier might begin with ONA to understand collaboration patterns during transition, then add OCM support for specific change initiatives, then incorporate BPE for production workflow redesign. Each phase delivers independent value while building toward broader transformation.

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value

**Scenario 1: EV Production Launch Delays Due to Cross-Functional Coordination Issues**

*Situation:* A tier-1 automotive supplier won a contract to produce battery thermal management components. Engineering designed the components, manufacturing prepared the line, quality control established inspection protocols. But six months into production, yields remained 30% below target. Analysis showed multiple handoff failures between engineering, manufacturing, and quality teams.

*Rooted's Approach:* ONA mapping revealed that engineering had designed components based on theoretical specifications without input from manufacturing on producibility. Manufacturing made undocumented process adjustments to compensate, creating inconsistencies. Quality control inspected to original specifications, rejecting parts that actually met functional requirements.

We facilitated cross-functional process mapping sessions that brought all three teams together to redesign workflows. Engineering incorporated manufacturing constraints into design specifications. Manufacturing documented all process modifications. Quality control updated inspection criteria based on actual functional requirements. Result: 85% yield within three months, 40% reduction in rework time.

**Scenario 2: Supplier Network Disruption During ICE-to-EV Transition**

*Situation:* A regional automotive manufacturer planned transition from ICE drivetrain components to EV power electronics. Their supplier base, built over 30 years for ICE parts, had minimal EV capability. Procurement attempted to source new suppliers but couldn't integrate them into existing processes. Production delays mounted.

*Rooted's Approach:* Rather than treating this as purely a sourcing problem, we used ONA to map the informal supplier relationship networks that enabled rapid problem-solving. We discovered critical knowledge and relationships concentrated in three procurement specialists who were excluded from EV sourcing decisions.

We redesigned the supplier transition process to integrate these specialists, created structured knowledge transfer protocols between ICE and EV sourcing teams, and established cross-functional supplier evaluation criteria. OCM work addressed cultural tensions between "legacy" procurement team and new "EV" team. Result: Supplier integration time cut from nine months to four months, supply chain disruption costs reduced by $2.3M annually.

**Scenario 3: Workforce Displacement Resistance Slowing Battery Assembly Rollout**

*Situation:* An automotive components manufacturer automating battery assembly faced significant workforce resistance. Union negotiations stalled. Experienced workers called in sick at higher rates. Automation implementation fell three months behind schedule. Management viewed this as typical labor resistance.

*Rooted's Approach:* Our OD&E assessment revealed the real issue wasn't automation opposition—it was lack of clarity about future roles. Workers scheduled for reassignment had no information about new positions, required training, or job security. Managers avoided difficult conversations, leaving information vacuums filled by rumors.

We designed a comprehensive transition communication plan with specific career pathways for affected workers, established reskilling programs aligned with new roles, and created formal feedback mechanisms for workers to voice concerns. OCM work coached managers on having direct, honest conversations about transitions. Result: Union agreement finalized within six weeks, sick rates returned to baseline, automation implementation completed one month ahead of revised schedule.

**Scenario 4: EV Strategy Execution Gaps Between Leadership and Front Line**

*Situation:* An automotive manufacturer announced aggressive EV transition strategy with timelines, investment commitments, and production targets. Twelve months later, implementation lagged significantly. Leadership blamed insufficient urgency. Front-line teams blamed unrealistic expectations and inadequate resources.

*Rooted's Approach:* ONA revealed massive disconnection between leadership's strategic vision and front-line reality. Leadership discussed "EV transition" as unified strategy. Front-line teams saw competing, uncoordinated initiatives without clear priorities. Information flowed poorly between layers, creating confusion about decision authority and resource allocation.

We facilitated strategy translation workshops that converted high-level EV goals into specific operational changes with clear ownership. We redesigned communication structures to create two-way information flow rather than top-down announcements. BPE work identified and eliminated duplicative initiatives consuming resources without strategic value. Result: Strategic initiative completion rate increased from 40% to 78% within six months, employee understanding of EV strategy jumped from 35% to 82% in engagement surveys.

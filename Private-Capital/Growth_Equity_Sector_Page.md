# Growth Equity
## Organizational Excellence for Market Leaders

---

### Industry Context
*Current market dynamics and organizational pressures*

Growth equity occupies a distinctive and increasingly important position in private capital markets—investing in established companies with proven business models that need capital to accelerate expansion. In 2024, growth equity deal count rose 15.1% year-over-year to 1,145 deals, with $75.8 billion in capital deployed, marking a 4.9% increase from the previous year. This resilience stands in contrast to both venture capital's struggles with early-stage funding and buyout firms' exit challenges.

The growth equity model appeals to both investors and companies precisely because it occupies the middle ground. Unlike venture capital's high-risk, high-reward approach to unproven businesses, growth equity targets companies that have already demonstrated product-market fit, sustainable unit economics, and clear paths to profitability. Unlike leveraged buyouts that use significant debt and take majority control, growth equity typically involves minority stake investments (20-40% ownership) financed with equity rather than debt, allowing founding teams to maintain control while accessing capital for expansion.

Recent academic research analyzing fund performance from 1979-2012 found that growth equity delivered competitive median returns while exhibiting lower volatility than venture capital. The strategy has emerged as critical for companies choosing to stay private longer—with many firms now remaining privately held for 8-10 years versus the traditional 4-6 years before IPO. This extended private ownership creates sustained demand for growth capital from companies that have outgrown venture funding but aren't ready for or interested in public markets.

The 2024-2025 environment presents both challenges and opportunities for growth equity firms. Fundraising remained difficult, with total growth equity fundraising volume and value falling 22.5% and 30.3% year-over-year respectively through Q3 2024. However, the companies in growth equity's sweet spot—those generating $10-100 million in revenue with strong fundamentals—are increasingly attractive as investors focus on quality over hype. The market correction has eliminated tourist capital and refocused everyone on sustainable growth, operational excellence, and clear value creation beyond just revenue expansion.

Technology, healthcare, and business services continue to dominate growth equity investment, with AI and software companies leading deal activity. Climate technology and infrastructure investments are also gaining momentum as growth equity firms recognize the opportunity to deploy capital into proven solutions ready for commercial scale. The key differentiator for successful growth equity firms in 2025: deep operational expertise that helps portfolio companies not just grow revenue but build organizational infrastructure for sustained market leadership.

### Common Operational Challenges
*Where scaling complexity meets operational reality*

**The Complexity Ceiling**
Your portfolio company is stuck. Revenue is growing 25-30% annually—good but not great. Margins are flat or declining slightly. Operational complexity is growing faster than revenue, and leadership can't pinpoint why. The company has outgrown the informal structures that worked at $20M but hasn't built the operational infrastructure needed for $100M. They're caught between startup and enterprise, and every attempt to add structure feels bureaucratic rather than enabling.

**Geographic Expansion Without Operational Fragmentation**
Your portfolio company is expanding from one region to three, from domestic to international, or from one product line to multiple verticals. This expansion is exactly what you invested to enable. But six months in, you discover that each new geography is operating independently with different processes, different vendor relationships, and different go-to-market approaches. The expansion hasn't created an integrated platform—it's created three separate businesses operating under one brand. Scale efficiencies aren't materializing, and operational complexity is exploding.

**Professionalizing Management While Preserving Agility**
The founder-led management team that built the business to $50M often lacks the experience to scale it to $250M. You need to professionalize management—add experienced executives, implement real processes, create functional expertise. But if you over-rotate to "big company" management too quickly, you kill the entrepreneurial agility and speed that made the company successful. Finding the right balance between professionalizing and preserving culture is incredibly difficult.

**Building for Scale Before You Have Scale**
Growth equity investments bet on future scale—$50M companies that will reach $200M+. But building organizational infrastructure for future scale requires investing ahead of revenue, which feels risky when you're still proving the growth thesis. Your portfolio companies face constant tension: invest in infrastructure now (reducing short-term profitability) or wait until scale demands it (risking organizational breakdown).

**The Talent Quantity-Quality Dilemma**
To achieve projected growth rates, your portfolio companies need to add 30-50 high-quality hires annually. But hiring at that pace almost always dilutes quality, especially in competitive talent markets. The leadership team is spending 40% of their time recruiting, yet new employees take 6-9 months to become fully productive because onboarding can't keep pace with hiring volume. The growth imperative conflicts with the reality that organizational capability can't be bought at speed.

**Measuring What Actually Matters**
Your portfolio companies have dozens of KPIs tracking everything from customer acquisition costs to employee engagement. But when you ask "which metrics truly predict sustainable growth?" leadership struggles to answer. They're measuring activity rather than outcomes, tracking operational metrics that don't connect to strategic goals, and drowning in data without generating insight. The measurement infrastructure isn't driving better decisions—it's creating reporting theater.

### Where Executives Get Stuck
*The invisible handbrakes on growth equity performance*

**The Profitable Growth Paradox**
Here's the trap: Your portfolio company needs to demonstrate profitable growth to justify valuation and support exit options. But the investments required to build sustainable infrastructure—better processes, stronger teams, improved systems—reduce short-term profitability. Leadership feels caught between showing attractive near-term numbers and making the organizational investments needed for long-term success. They optimize for this quarter's EBITDA and defer organizational investments, creating a brittle foundation that will crack under future growth pressure.

**Misalignment Between Growth Strategy and Operating Model**
The company has a clear growth strategy: expand into enterprise customers, launch adjacent product lines, enter new geographies. Leadership has committed to aggressive revenue targets that assume successful expansion. But the operating model—how teams are structured, how decisions are made, how functions collaborate—was designed for the old business. No one redesigned the organization to support the new strategy, so expansion happens despite the organization rather than enabled by it.

**Hidden Collaboration Tax**
As companies scale from $30M to $100M in revenue, they add functional specialization: separate teams for sales, marketing, customer success, product, operations, finance. This specialization creates expertise but requires extensive collaboration to be effective. Yet most growth equity portfolio companies don't design for collaboration—they just add teams and assume they'll figure out how to work together. The result is a massive "collaboration tax": endless meetings, slow decisions, duplicated work, and frustration. Leadership can see the symptoms (slow execution, team friction) but can't identify the organizational root cause.

**Cultural Dilution at Scale**
The company culture that attracted great early employees and differentiated the company in the market was created organically by the first 25 people. Now the company is adding 10-15 employees per quarter, and that culture is diluting rapidly. New employees don't naturally absorb the values and working styles that made the company special because they're not explicitly taught. Within 24 months, long-tenured employees start saying "this place isn't what it used to be," but leadership struggles to articulate what changed or how to preserve culture during continued growth.

**Leadership Team Growing Pains**
Your portfolio company's leadership team is a mix of founders who've been there since the beginning, early employees promoted into leadership, and external hires brought in for functional expertise. This team has never gelled into an effective unit—they have competing priorities, poor communication, and unresolved tensions about strategy and resource allocation. The dysfunction at the leadership level cascades through the entire organization, creating misalignment, confusion, and slow execution. But addressing leadership team effectiveness feels risky because no one wants to admit the team isn't working.

**Exit Readiness as an Afterthought**
Most growth equity investors think about exit 12-18 months before targeting a transaction. But strategic buyers or public market investors are evaluating organizational health, management depth, scalability of operations, and cultural vitality—characteristics that take years to build. Companies that command premium valuations have organizational infrastructure that demonstrates they're ready for the next phase of growth. By the time you're actively preparing for exit, organizational weaknesses are difficult to fix and become valuation concerns.

### How Rooted Helps Growth Equity Firms
*Building organizational infrastructure that enables sustainable scaling*

#### Organizational Network Analysis (ONA)
We map the actual patterns of collaboration, information flow, and influence inside your portfolio companies. This reveals how organizations really operate versus how they're supposed to work according to the org chart.

For a $80M revenue business services company expanding through acquisitions, we used ONA to understand why integration was failing. The company had completed four add-on acquisitions but wasn't achieving expected synergies. ONA revealed that the acquired companies were still operating independently 18 months post-acquisition—they had separate communication patterns, no cross-company collaboration, and maintained distinct operational approaches. We showed leadership exactly where to focus integration efforts and designed interventions that built connections between previously separate teams. Within 12 months, the platform achieved 75% of targeted synergies and created a scalable acquisition integration playbook for future deals.

We worked with a SaaS company preparing for exit where ONA revealed heavy dependence on three employees who weren't in formal leadership positions. These individuals were critical knowledge brokers, connecting disparate parts of the organization and enabling cross-functional collaboration. Yet their importance was invisible to the leadership team and would have been a red flag in buyer diligence. We helped the company distribute that knowledge and connection across the organization, reducing key person risk and strengthening organizational resilience before the sale process began.

#### Organizational Change Management (OCM)
Growth equity portfolio companies are constantly evolving: new markets, new products, new operating models, new systems. We build change capabilities that enable transformation without organizational disruption.

A healthcare technology company needed to transition from subscription-based revenue to outcome-based pricing—a fundamental business model change that impacted sales, product, customer success, and finance. This wasn't just a pricing change; it required different sales skills, different product capabilities, different customer success approaches, and entirely new internal processes. We designed and implemented the change management strategy that helped employees understand the strategic rationale, prepared them for new ways of working, and built confidence in the new model. The company successfully transitioned 60% of customers to outcome-based pricing within 18 months while maintaining revenue growth and customer satisfaction.

For portfolio companies implementing new ERP systems, CRM platforms, or other enterprise tools during growth, we prevent the productivity losses that typically accompany major system implementations. We've helped dozens of companies maintain operational velocity through technology transformations by building change readiness, creating effective training programs, and ensuring leadership actively supports adoption.

#### Business Process Engineering (BPE)
Growth equity companies need to professionalize operations without becoming bureaucratic. We engineer processes that enable efficiency and scale while maintaining the agility that made companies successful.

A $65M specialty manufacturing company was growing but couldn't improve margins because operational complexity was growing faster than revenue. Every new product line added operational burden, custom workflows, and specialized knowledge that only a few people understood. We mapped their end-to-end operations and discovered that 40% of production management time was spent on exception handling because there were no standardized processes. We redesigned core workflows, created standard operating procedures for repetitive activities, and built clear escalation paths for true exceptions. Production throughput increased 30%, margin improved 4 percentage points, and the company could scale to $150M with the same operational leadership team.

When growth equity portfolio companies prepare for strategic sales, buyers increasingly evaluate operational maturity. We help companies engineer the processes that demonstrate scale-readiness: customer acquisition, delivery operations, customer success, financial planning. These aren't bureaucratic processes—they're the operational infrastructure that proves the company can grow efficiently and demonstrates to buyers that the business is institutionalized rather than dependent on individual heroics.

#### Organizational Development & Effectiveness (OD&E)
Sustained growth requires developing leadership capability, strengthening culture, and building organizations that can execute today's strategy while adapting to future needs.

A $90M professional services firm needed to transition from entrepreneurial leadership to institutional management as part of growth equity funding. The founder-CEO had built an exceptional business but operated informally with limited structure. We didn't recommend replacing the founder—we helped build the executive team structure around them. We designed the leadership team architecture, helped recruit and onboard the CFO, COO, and Head of Sales, and created the operating rhythm that made the executive team effective. We coached the founder-CEO through the transition from doing everything to leading leaders. Eighteen months later, the company had a fully functioning executive team, the CEO had successfully evolved their leadership style, and the company reached $140M in revenue while maintaining the entrepreneurial culture that differentiated it.

For portfolio companies scaling from 50 to 200+ employees, we help preserve and intentionally evolve culture. We work with leadership teams to articulate core cultural values, design onboarding experiences that transmit those values to new employees at scale, and create reinforcement mechanisms that maintain culture through growth. We've helped companies successfully scale culture across multiple geographies, through acquisitions, and during periods of hypergrowth.

### Why Growth Equity Firms Work With Rooted
*What makes us different from traditional growth consultants*

**We Understand the Growth Equity Investment Thesis**
Growth equity firms invest in companies that have proven business models and need to scale efficiently. We design organizational solutions that support that thesis—not startup-style rapid experimentation and not enterprise-scale bureaucracy, but the operational infrastructure appropriate for companies in the growth phase. Our recommendations match where portfolio companies actually are and where they need to go to deliver expected returns.

**Operational Focus That Matters to Investors**
We measure success the way you do: revenue growth, margin improvement, customer retention, and organizational efficiency that demonstrates scale-readiness. We don't optimize for employee satisfaction scores as an end goal—we optimize for organizational effectiveness that drives business outcomes. Every engagement includes clear KPIs tied to value creation, and we track progress against them throughout.

**Right-Sized for Middle Market Reality**
Growth equity portfolio companies typically have $30-150M in revenue, 100-500 employees, and lean central resources. We design organizational solutions that fit this reality—practical interventions that can be led by executives with day jobs, implemented in 90-120 days, and adapted as the company continues growing. We're not trying to build enterprise-grade infrastructure; we're building the right infrastructure for growth-stage companies.

**No Big 5 Premium Without Big 5 Value**
The major consulting firms charge premium rates because of their brand recognition. But when you're working with a $70M revenue company that's still investing heavily in growth, those premium rates don't make economic sense. We provide senior practitioner expertise without the brand premium—partner-level consultants who do the actual work, at pricing that aligns with growth equity economics.

**Partnership Approach, Not Dependency**
We're not trying to create ongoing consulting relationships that make portfolio companies dependent on external support. We build internal capability, transfer knowledge to company leadership, and design solutions that can be sustained internally after we exit. Many engagements involve coaching internal leaders to own organizational development going forward, ensuring companies can manage their own organizational evolution.

### Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value
*Real situations where organizational strategy drives growth equity success*

**Building Infrastructure for Next-Phase Growth**
A $45M revenue marketing technology company had strong product-market fit and loyal customers but had plateaued at 15-20% annual growth. The growth equity investor's thesis was that the company could reach $150M+ with the right infrastructure and strategy. But the organization was still operating like a startup—informal processes, reactive decision-making, unclear accountability, and limited functional expertise.

We conducted organizational assessment and built the infrastructure that enabled acceleration. We helped leadership design the functional org structure needed for scale, identified which leadership positions to fill internally versus externally, and created the operational processes that brought order without bureaucracy. We developed the leadership team's strategic planning capabilities and built the performance management infrastructure that connected strategy to execution. Within 18 months, the company had professional management infrastructure, achieved 40% annual revenue growth, and built the operational foundation that supported scaling to $120M. The organizational transformation was central to the successful strategic sale that followed.

**Post-Investment Operating Model Redesign**
A $60M distribution company received growth equity funding to consolidate a fragmented market through acquisitions and organic growth. The plan was to complete 5-7 acquisitions over 24 months. But the existing operating model wasn't designed for rapid integration—there were no standard processes, each location operated independently, and the company lacked the organizational infrastructure to successfully integrate acquisitions.

We redesigned the operating model for acquisition-driven growth. We created standardized core processes that could be replicated across acquisitions, built the integration playbook that would guide future deals, and developed the internal integration team that would execute it. We helped leadership create the organizational infrastructure that turned the company into an acquisition platform rather than just an acquirer. Over 30 months, the company successfully integrated six acquisitions, grew revenue to $140M, and achieved planned synergies. The operating model we designed became a competitive advantage that made the company a preferred buyer in a fragmented market.

**Leadership Team Development for Scale**
A $85M professional services firm had grown successfully but with a leadership team that had never operated at scale. The management team were excellent practitioners who'd been promoted into leadership but lacked experience building organizations, developing strategy, or leading through transformation. The growth equity investor recognized that leadership capability was the constraint preventing the company from reaching $200M.

We developed the leadership team's capabilities through structured coaching, strategic planning facilitation, and hands-on support during key initiatives. We helped them learn to set strategy, make data-driven decisions, develop their teams, and execute with accountability. We coached individual leaders on their specific development needs and facilitated executive team sessions that built trust and collaboration. Within 24 months, the same leadership team that initially struggled with scale was successfully executing a multi-year growth strategy, leading a 300-person organization, and preparing the company for strategic exit. The investor didn't need to replace management—they needed to develop the management they had.

**Preserving Culture During Rapid Geographic Expansion**
A $50M technology services company was expanding from the U.S. to Europe and Asia-Pacific to serve global clients. The expansion was strategic and well-planned from a market perspective, but the company hadn't thought about organizational implications. How do you hire 80 people in three new geographies while maintaining the culture and operating standards that made the company successful?

We designed the organizational approach for global expansion. We helped leadership articulate the cultural values and operating principles that needed to be preserved across geographies, created the onboarding and training programs that would transmit those to new international employees, and built the communication and collaboration infrastructure that kept global teams connected. We identified which roles needed to be locally hired for market knowledge versus which should relocate from headquarters, and designed decision-making frameworks that balanced local autonomy with global consistency. The company successfully expanded to 200+ employees across three continents while maintaining consistent culture, quality, and operational standards. International revenue grew from 5% to 45% of total revenue within three years, and the global operational infrastructure supported a successful strategic sale to a larger platform.

# Private Credit
## Organizational Excellence for Alternative Lending

---

### Industry Context
*Current market dynamics and organizational pressures*

Private credit has evolved from a niche financing alternative into a $1.7 trillion asset class that is fundamentally reshaping corporate lending. The industry is projected to reach nearly $2.8 trillion by 2028, growing at a pace that outstrips most traditional asset classes. This expansion reflects a structural shift in the lending landscape: banks continue retreating from leveraged lending following post-financial crisis regulations, creating sustained opportunity for non-bank lenders to fill the gap.

The 2024-2025 environment presents both opportunity and complexity for private credit firms. Higher interest rates—though declining from peaks—have delivered strong returns to investors, with floating-rate structures protecting against inflation. Direct lending yields remain well above historical levels, with new-issue yields around 4.5% base rates compared to sub-1% levels that prevailed for years after 2008. This creates attractive economics for lenders who can effectively manage credit risk in a higher-rate environment.

Yet success requires operational sophistication that many firms haven't built. The cumulative impact of elevated rates is creating stress in certain portfolios, particularly older vintages where borrowers face pressure servicing debt. Default rates across high-yield issuers are projected at 5.5% in 2025, and approximately 25% of the high-yield index is now rated B- or lower—compared to around 5% in 2008. Private credit managers are capitalizing on new origination opportunities at higher base rates, but they're also navigating increased complexity in portfolio monitoring, workout situations, and risk management.

The industry is simultaneously expanding into new strategies beyond traditional direct lending: asset-based finance, specialty finance, opportunistic credit, and private real estate debt. Institutional demand is rising as corporate pensions rotate out of equities into higher-yielding private investment-grade credit. Competition is intensifying as more players enter the market, creating pressure to differentiate through operational excellence rather than just capital deployment.

For private credit firms in 2025, operational capability is becoming the competitive differentiator. The winners will be firms that can originate quality deals in competitive markets, structure flexible capital solutions, actively manage portfolios through stress, and build the organizational infrastructure that allows them to scale without proportionally increasing risk or operational overhead.

### Common Operational Challenges
*Where portfolio complexity meets operational reality*

**Portfolio Monitoring at Scale**
Your firm manages 80+ direct lending relationships across multiple sectors and geographies. Each borrower requires regular covenant monitoring, financial reporting analysis, and proactive risk assessment. But with finite resources and growing portfolio size, comprehensive monitoring becomes increasingly difficult. You're stuck between the need for detailed oversight and the reality that your team can't review every borrower deeply every quarter. The risk is that deterioration goes unnoticed until it becomes a problem requiring workout resources.

**Deal Origination Without Differentiation**
Competition for quality deals has intensified dramatically. Banks are returning to certain segments of the market, and dozens of private credit firms are chasing the same opportunities. Your firm needs to differentiate beyond just offering capital—but what does that actually mean? Most firms claim "value-added partnership" and "flexible capital solutions" without tangible differentiation. The origination team is working harder to find deals, but win rates are declining and pricing is compressing.

**Credit Risk Assessment Standardization**
Each investment professional has their own approach to underwriting deals and assessing credit risk. Some are conservative, others aggressive. There's no standardized framework for how you evaluate sectors, structures, or covenants. This variability creates inconsistency in portfolio quality and makes it difficult to compare opportunities or aggregate risk exposure across the portfolio. Senior leadership can't easily answer "what's our exposure to cyclical sectors?" or "how many deals have covenant cushions below 15%?" because the data isn't standardized.

**Resource Allocation Between Origination and Portfolio Management**
Your team is small and specialized. The same people who source and close deals are also responsible for managing existing portfolio companies and handling workout situations. When markets are active, origination gets priority and portfolio monitoring suffers. When a borrower requires intensive management or restructuring, it consumes resources that should be focused on new investments. There's never enough capacity to do both excellently, so you're making implicit tradeoffs that create risk.

**Rapid Team Scaling Without Experience Dilution**
To deploy growing capital commitments, you need to double your investment team in 18 months. But experienced private credit professionals are expensive and in high demand. You're hiring people from banking, public credit markets, or operational roles who bring relevant skills but lack direct lending experience. How do you maintain underwriting quality and portfolio management standards when your team's average experience drops from 12 years to 6 years?

**Data Infrastructure That Doesn't Support Decision-Making**
Your firm has data scattered across Excel spreadsheets, email threads, shared drives, and various systems. There's no single source of truth for portfolio performance, covenant compliance, or borrower financials. Creating investment committee materials requires manual data aggregation that takes days. Risk dashboards are static reports rather than dynamic tools. The infrastructure doesn't support the sophisticated portfolio management that's increasingly necessary as portfolios grow and markets become more complex.

### Where Executives Get Stuck
*The invisible handbrakes on private credit performance*

**The Illusion of Portfolio Health**
Here's what we see repeatedly: A private credit firm reports strong portfolio performance—low non-performing loans, stable credit ratings, minimal writedowns. Leadership believes the portfolio is healthy. But beneath the surface, there are early warning signs that aren't being captured: covenant cushions eroding, EBITDA flat while debt service increases, management turnover at key borrowers, delayed financial reporting. By the time problems surface formally, they've been building for quarters. The monitoring infrastructure isn't designed to catch deterioration early; it's designed to report problems after they've matured.

**Origination Culture That Deprioritizes Portfolio Management**
Most private credit firms are origination-centric—compensation, status, and career advancement reward deal volume and capital deployment. Portfolio management is seen as less prestigious "maintenance work." This creates perverse incentives: investment professionals don't want to spend time on portfolio companies because it doesn't advance their careers the way new deals do. Problem credits get attention only when they demand it. This cultural misalignment means portfolio management remains systematically under-resourced and undervalued until a crisis forces change.

**Information Asymmetry in Direct Relationships**
Direct lending creates deep relationships with borrowers—which is valuable but also risky. Your team knows the borrowers well, talks to them regularly, and develops trust. But that closeness can create blind spots. Investment professionals may not recognize deterioration because they're too close to the situation or too invested in believing their original thesis. There's no independent check on whether the direct relationship is generating accurate information or whether the borrower is managing the narrative. Without separation between origination and ongoing credit assessment, conflicts of interest can undermine portfolio management.

**The Workout Capacity Gap**
Most private credit firms staff for normal operations, not stress. When markets are healthy and portfolios are performing, this works fine. But when multiple credits deteriorate simultaneously—whether due to rate pressure, sector downturn, or broader economic stress—firms discover they don't have the specialized workout expertise needed. Senior investment professionals who originated deals are suddenly spending 80% of their time on restructurings, but they may not have the technical skills for complex workouts. By the time the firm realizes it needs dedicated workout resources, the problems have escalated.

**Scale Without Systems**
Firms that grew rapidly from $500M to $5B in assets under management often haven't built the operational infrastructure to match. They're still operating with the processes and systems that worked at $1B. Portfolio monitoring is manual, deal approvals are informal, risk aggregation requires heroic effort. This works until it doesn't. The breaking point usually comes during a market disruption when the firm needs real-time risk visibility and coordinated response—and discovers the infrastructure doesn't exist.

### How Rooted Helps Private Credit Firms
*Building organizational capability for sustainable growth*

#### Organizational Network Analysis (ONA)
We map how information flows through your organization—between origination teams, credit analysis, portfolio management, and leadership. This reveals where knowledge silos exist, which relationships are critical for decision-making, and whether your structure enables effective risk management.

For a $3B direct lending firm, ONA revealed that portfolio monitoring and origination teams worked completely independently despite both needing to understand borrower performance. Portfolio managers discovered problems through quarterly reviews that origination teams had already heard about in informal conversations weeks earlier. The disconnection meant problems weren't escalating quickly, and origination wasn't learning from portfolio experience. We helped them create formal communication structures that connected the functions, and early warning sign identification improved dramatically.

We worked with a private credit firm that had grown through acquisitions, adding teams from different platforms. On paper, they were one firm. In reality, each legacy team operated independently with different underwriting standards, monitoring approaches, and portfolio management styles. ONA showed exactly where integration was failing and which relationships needed to be built to create consistent practices across the platform. This organizational integration became critical to the firm's ability to deploy capital efficiently and manage risk consistently.

#### Organizational Change Management (OCM)
Private credit firms face constant transformation: new strategies (specialty finance, opportunistic credit), new systems (portfolio monitoring platforms, deal management systems), new risk frameworks. We build change capabilities that enable transformation without disrupting deal flow or portfolio management.

A mid-market direct lending firm needed to implement enterprise-grade portfolio monitoring and risk management systems as they prepared to scale from $2B to $10B in AUM. This required changing how investment professionals tracked borrowers, reported performance, and participated in credit reviews. The risk was that the new systems would create administrative burden that distracted from core investment activities. We designed the change management approach that helped the team understand why new systems were necessary, trained them on efficient workflows, and built adoption through early wins that demonstrated value. The systems implementation succeeded without productivity losses, and the firm now has infrastructure appropriate for their growth trajectory.

For private credit firms adding new strategies (e.g., a direct lending firm launching asset-based finance), we manage the organizational implications. New strategies require different expertise, different risk frameworks, and different operating models. We help firms integrate new strategies without creating organizational silos or confusing decision-making authorities.

#### Business Process Engineering (BPE)
Sustainable growth in private credit requires operational processes that support quality at scale. We engineer underwriting workflows, portfolio monitoring procedures, and risk management frameworks that enable growth without proportionally growing headcount or overhead.

A private credit firm was originating 40+ deals annually but couldn't track covenant compliance efficiently. Each investment professional maintained their own spreadsheets, and there was no centralized monitoring system. We mapped the end-to-end portfolio management workflow and discovered that 50% of analyst time was spent on manual data entry and spreadsheet updates rather than actual credit analysis. We redesigned the process with standardized data capture, automated covenant tracking, and exception-based reporting that flagged only items requiring attention. Portfolio monitoring became 60% more efficient, and analysts could focus on actual credit assessment rather than administrative tasks.

When a specialty finance firm needed to standardize underwriting across three different lending strategies (equipment finance, receivables finance, and inventory lending), we created the unified underwriting framework that maintained strategy-specific requirements while standardizing risk assessment, documentation, and approval processes. The standardization improved underwriting quality, accelerated deal closing timelines, and created consistency that made portfolio-level risk aggregation actually possible.

#### Organizational Development & Effectiveness (OD&E)
Private credit firms need leadership teams that can manage both growth and risk simultaneously—deploying capital aggressively while maintaining credit quality. We develop leadership capacity, strengthen organizational culture, and build decision-making effectiveness.

A private credit firm had grown from 15 to 75 employees in three years, but the leadership team still operated like a startup—informal decision-making, unclear authorities, reactive rather than strategic. We helped them transition to institutional leadership: defined executive team roles and responsibilities, created decision-making frameworks for different issue types, established operating rhythms that connected strategy to execution, and developed individual leaders' capabilities to manage functions at scale. The transformation took 12 months, but the result was an executive team capable of leading a $5B platform rather than a $500M firm.

For investment teams rapidly adding junior professionals, we accelerate onboarding and development. Private credit requires sophisticated credit judgment that normally takes years to develop. We help firms create structured development programs that build credit skills faster—mentorship frameworks, deal review processes, and progressive responsibility models that accelerate junior professional development without compromising underwriting quality.

### Why Private Credit Firms Work With Rooted
*What makes us different from traditional financial services consultants*

**We Understand Private Credit Operations**
We know the difference between direct lending, asset-based finance, and opportunistic credit. We understand covenant structures, waterfall priorities, and what makes a good credit memo. Our recommendations reflect actual private credit operating reality, not generic financial services advice adapted to your industry.

**Focus on Scalable Operations**
Private credit firms are growing rapidly—often doubling AUM every 2-3 years. We design organizational solutions that scale: processes that work for 40 deals and 400 deals, systems that support $2B and $20B, teams that can grow without losing effectiveness. We're not solving today's problem; we're building infrastructure for your five-year growth trajectory.

**No Conflict With Your Business Model**
We're organizational strategy consultants, not fundraising advisors or capital markets intermediaries. We have no conflicts of interest with your business model or deal flow. Our only goal is making your firm more operationally effective at originating, underwriting, and managing credit investments.

**Practical Solutions for Resource-Constrained Reality**
Private credit firms operate lean compared to their bank competitors. We design solutions that fit resource-constrained reality: interventions that can be led by existing team members, implemented in 60-120 days, and sustained without creating permanent consulting dependency. We transfer knowledge rather than create dependency.

**Experience With Regulated and Unregulated Models**
Whether your firm is a BDC, CLO manager, interval fund, or private fund, we understand the operational and organizational implications of different structures. Our recommendations account for regulatory requirements, reporting obligations, and structural constraints specific to your model.

### Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value
*Real situations where organizational strategy drives private credit success*

**Building Portfolio Management Infrastructure for Scale**
A $4B direct lending firm had grown rapidly through strong origination but hadn't invested in portfolio management infrastructure. Monitoring was inconsistent, covenant compliance tracking was manual, and there was no systematic approach to identifying deteriorating credits. The firm's LPs were increasingly sophisticated and demanding better transparency into portfolio health and risk management practices.

We conducted operational assessment and designed the portfolio management infrastructure appropriate for their scale. We helped them standardize covenant monitoring, create risk rating frameworks that enabled portfolio-level risk aggregation, and build the reporting infrastructure that provided real-time visibility into portfolio health. We identified which functions should be centralized (compliance monitoring, financial analysis) versus distributed (relationship management, workout support). Most importantly, we helped them create the organizational structure that made portfolio management a valued function with clear career paths—not just maintenance work. Within 18 months, the firm had institutional-grade portfolio management that supported raising their next fund and expanding into more complex credit strategies.

**Integrating Acquisitions Without Losing Deal Capability**
A $2B private credit platform acquired a $800M specialty finance manager to add product breadth and expand distribution. The strategic logic was sound, but organizational integration was failing. The acquired team still operated completely independently, using different systems, different underwriting standards, and different portfolio management approaches. The platform wasn't achieving expected synergies, and there was growing tension between legacy teams and the acquired business about "the right way" to do things.

We designed the integration strategy that respected the specialized expertise of the specialty finance team while creating platform-wide standards for the things that mattered most: risk management, compliance, reporting, and LP communication. We helped leadership navigate the cultural integration—acknowledging that different strategies required different approaches while building shared identity around credit excellence. We facilitated the difficult conversations about comp structures, titles, and decision-making authorities that were creating friction. Twelve months after our engagement began, the platform operated as an integrated business with consistent risk practices, shared systems, and a unified culture—while preserving the specialized capabilities that made the acquisition valuable.

**Developing Investment Team Capability During Rapid Growth**
A private credit firm was scaling from $1.5B to $6B in assets and needed to triple the investment team in 24 months. The challenge wasn't just hiring—it was maintaining underwriting quality and credit judgment as the team grew and average experience decreased. The founding partners were concerned that rapid expansion would dilute the firm's credit culture and discipline.

We built the development infrastructure that enabled growth without quality dilution. We created structured onboarding that transferred credit philosophy and underwriting standards to new team members systematically. We designed mentorship frameworks that paired junior professionals with experienced investors for progressive skill development. We established deal review forums that made credit judgment visible and teachable rather than implicit and individual. We helped the firm create clear competency models that defined expectations at each level and guided development. The result was a tripling of team size while maintaining consistent underwriting quality and preserving the firm's credit-first culture. LP feedback specifically noted that portfolio quality remained strong despite rapid team growth.

**Transitioning From Founder-Led to Institutional Platform**
A $3B direct lending firm was highly dependent on three founding partners who personally drove origination, maintained key relationships, and made all major credit decisions. As the firm prepared to raise its next fund and scale significantly, LPs were asking hard questions about succession planning, organizational depth, and whether the business was institutionalized or dependent on individuals.

We designed the organizational transition strategy: identifying which founder responsibilities could be distributed to next-generation leaders, which required external hires, and what organizational infrastructure was needed to reduce key person risk. We helped recruit and integrate the firm's first COO and Head of Portfolio Management—roles that didn't exist previously. We facilitated the difficult conversations about founders stepping back from day-to-day credit decisions and empowering next-generation investment professionals. We built the governance and decision-making frameworks that enabled the firm to operate effectively without founders in every decision. Most importantly, we helped founders evolve their roles from operators to strategic leaders—maintaining their influence and value while reducing operational dependency. The transformation took 18 months, and the firm successfully raised a $5B fund with LP confidence in institutional durability.

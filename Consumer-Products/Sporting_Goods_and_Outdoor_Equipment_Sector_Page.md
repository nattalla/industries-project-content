## Industry Context
*Navigating the new balancing act between growth and profitability*

The sporting goods and outdoor equipment industry is experiencing what McKinsey calls "the new balancing act"—a simultaneous focus on top-line growth and bottom-line profitability in an environment of persistent uncertainty. The global sporting goods market is projected to grow from $671 billion in 2024 to nearly $1.3 trillion by 2033. That's the good news. The challenging news: 84% of sporting goods executives expressed concern about the geopolitical environment's impact on their business, with potential tariff increases threatening pricing strategies and supply chain management.

For mid-market sporting goods and outdoor equipment companies, the market dynamics are particularly complex. Outdoor product sales in September 2024 were down across the board, affecting every major sales channel from specialty retailers to online platforms. Categories like hiking boots, trail running shoes, and outerwear saw sharp decreases in units sold and revenue. Yet paradoxically, outdoor recreation participation is up, the sector spent $123.9 billion in Q4 2024 (up from $68.2 billion in Q4 2018), and consumer interest remains strong.

The disconnect between participation growth and sales challenges reveals the real issue: inventory normalization that's been a lengthy process, shifts from high-ticket specialized gear to casual affordable products, and challenger brands taking market share from established players. From 2019 to 2024, the two largest incumbents (Nike and Adidas) lost three percentage points of market share while challenger brands like On, Hoka, and Lululemon gained ground through specialization and community building.

The industry faces a dual agenda: drive revenue growth while improving operational efficiency. Nearly half of sporting goods executives feel optimistic about 2025, signaling cautious confidence, but the path forward requires organizational capabilities most mid-market companies haven't built yet. Companies need to accelerate supply chain diversification to mitigate geopolitical risks, integrate technology and data analytics for customer insights and product innovation, balance DTC growth with wholesale relationships, and embed sustainability into operations without destroying profitability.

## Common Operational Challenges

Sporting goods and outdoor equipment executives are passionate about their products and the active lifestyle they enable. But the problems limiting growth aren't product-related—they're organizational.

**Inventory management chaos masquerading as market conditions.** Companies blame soft demand, but the real issue is often operational. Stockouts on best-sellers while carrying excess slow movers. Distribution centers optimized for bulk wholesale shipments struggling with individual DTC orders. Planning teams using forecasts that don't reflect actual consumer behavior. These aren't market problems—they're process and coordination problems.

**Siloed channel strategies creating internal competition.** DTC is growing, but wholesale still drives significant revenue. When these channels operate as separate businesses with different incentives, they compete against each other instead of serving customers holistically. Sales wants inventory allocated to retail partners. E-commerce wants inventory for direct customers. No one has authority to make trade-offs based on company profitability and customer experience. The result: firefighting, expedited shipping costs, and margin erosion.

**Supply chain complexity without coordination mechanisms.** Sporting goods companies source globally, manufacture across multiple countries, and distribute through diverse channels. Raw materials from one region, components from another, assembly somewhere else, with lead times ranging from weeks to months. Companies have invested in supply chain technology, but tools don't create coordination. When Procurement, Manufacturing, Quality, and Logistics optimize locally rather than holistically, disruptions cascade and costs spiral.

**Innovation bottlenecks despite "agile" aspirations.** The industry talks about speed and responsiveness to trends, but product development still takes 12-18 months. It's not because design is slow—it's because Design, Merchandising, Sourcing, and Operations have different priorities, unclear decision rights, and risk-averse approval processes. Every function has valid concerns, but without frameworks for making trade-offs and moving forward, innovation stalls while competitors launch.

## Where Executives Get Stuck

Here's what sporting goods and outdoor equipment leaders share in early conversations:

"We've been talking about 'omnichannel' for three years. We have DTC, we have wholesale partners, we have our own retail stores. But they all operate like separate businesses. Inventory allocation is a constant battle. The customer experience is fragmented. And we're spending a fortune on expedited shipping because we can't coordinate inventory effectively."

"Everyone agrees we need to respond faster to trends and consumer preferences. We see what's working on social media, we know what competitors are launching. But by the time we get a product to market, the trend has moved on. It's not that we don't know what to do—it's that we can't make decisions and execute fast enough."

"We acquired a direct-to-consumer outdoor brand that was growing 60% annually with their loyal community and social media presence. We wanted to scale them with our supply chain, manufacturing relationships, and retail distribution. Instead, we've slowed them down. Their team is frustrated by our processes, their innovation has stalled, and key talent is leaving. We're killing what we paid for."

"Sustainability is important to our customers and we take it seriously. But when we try to shift to more sustainable materials, redesign products for durability and repair, or implement take-back programs, we get stuck. Supply Chain says sustainable materials cost more and have reliability issues. Manufacturing flags production complexity. Marketing questions whether customers will pay premium prices. Everyone has valid concerns, but we can't make decisions and move forward."

These aren't market problems or product problems. They're organizational capability gaps that strategy alone can't close.

## How Rooted Helps Sporting Goods & Outdoor Equipment Leaders

### Organizational Network Analysis (ONA): Seeing How Work Actually Happens

A $150M outdoor equipment manufacturer knew they had a product development problem. New products took 16 months from concept to launch when competitors were doing it in 10 months. The leadership team assumed the issue was either insufficient design resources or the stage-gate process having too many approval steps.

We used ONA to map how decisions, information, and collaboration actually happened across Product Development, Merchandising, Sourcing, Manufacturing, and Marketing. The data revealed something the org chart couldn't: these functions communicated through scheduled meetings that created delays, but rarely collaborated informally to solve problems quickly. Three senior leaders had become unintentional bottlenecks—every decision and trade-off escalated to them because no one else had clear authority.

More surprisingly, talented mid-level managers were already solving problems informally and creating workarounds to move faster—but this happened in the shadows, not as part of the official process. The company had organic collaboration happening but wasn't recognizing, supporting, or scaling it.

We didn't reorganize. We redesigned product development to push decision-making to cross-functional teams with clear authority, reduced approval layers, formalized the informal relationships that were already working, and coached leaders on getting out of the decision path for routine trade-offs. Product development cycle time dropped from 16 months to 11 months without adding headcount or changing the org chart.

### Organizational Change Management (OCM): Making Omnichannel Actually Work

A sporting goods company with wholesale, DTC, and owned retail channels was struggling with what they called "channel conflict." In reality, it was organizational misalignment creating internal competition. Each channel had different leaders, different goals, different inventory allocation rules, and different customer data systems. Sales teams prioritized wholesale partners. E-commerce team prioritized direct customers. Retail stores operated semi-independently. The result: inconsistent customer experiences, inventory allocation battles, expedited shipping costs, and margin erosion.

We didn't create another "omnichannel strategy" presentation. The strategy was clear—integrated customer experience, flexible fulfillment, unified inventory. What was missing was organizational alignment to execute it.

We facilitated working sessions where channel leaders mapped customer journeys and identified where fragmentation was destroying value. We redesigned incentive structures so channel leaders were rewarded for company performance, not just channel performance. We established cross-channel inventory allocation frameworks based on profitability and customer experience, not politics. We created unified customer data systems and trained teams on using them.

Critically, we coached the executive team on what omnichannel transformation actually requires: making hard trade-offs about resources and authority, addressing leaders who resisted losing control of "their" inventory, and reinforcing behaviors that optimize for customers and company performance rather than channel metrics.

Within six months, inventory utilization improved 23%, expedited shipping costs dropped 40%, customer satisfaction scores increased across all channels, and the leadership team was making decisions together instead of fighting about allocation.

### Business Process Engineering (BPE): Designing Operations for Speed and Profitability

A mid-market outdoor apparel brand was growing fast but profitability was declining. Revenue was up 25%, but operating margin had fallen from 12% to 8%. The CFO blamed pricing pressure. The CEO blamed operational inefficiency. Both were partially right, but the real issue was that processes designed for $80M in revenue were breaking at $140M.

We didn't start with cost-cutting. We started by understanding how work actually flowed through the organization and where operational complexity was creating hidden costs. Through observation and interviews with planning, sourcing, manufacturing coordination, fulfillment, and customer service teams, we discovered the real problems.

Every product SKU was planned and forecasted independently, creating forecast inaccuracy and inventory imbalances. Sourcing operated reactively to expedite shortages rather than proactively to prevent them. Customer service spent enormous time finding orders and explaining delays because information didn't flow between systems. Returns were processed manually, taking days and creating customer friction. Each issue seemed small individually, but collectively they were destroying margins.

We redesigned core processes holistically: demand planning that used pattern recognition and family-level forecasting; sourcing that balanced lead time, cost, and risk strategically; fulfillment that prioritized accuracy and speed while controlling costs; returns processing that was automated, fast, and fed insights back to Product Development and Quality.

Operating margin recovered to 11.2% within 12 months without cutting headcount or raising prices. Order accuracy improved from 91% to 97%. Customer satisfaction scores increased. And the operations team went from firefighting to continuous improvement because the processes were designed for the scale the business had reached.

### Organizational Development & Effectiveness (OD&E): Building Leadership That Can Scale Specialty Brands

A $100M outdoor equipment brand had grown organically through product quality and community building. The founder was a legendary figure in the outdoor community—trusted, authentic, passionate. The leadership team were all outdoor enthusiasts promoted from within. Their passion for the product and community was unmatched. Their capability to lead a scaling organization was stretched.

Cross-functional initiatives stalled because no one had experience navigating organizational complexity. Strategic decisions took too long because the founder was involved in everything. Planning processes were informal and personality-driven rather than structured and predictable. Talented people were leaving because growth created chaos rather than opportunity.

We designed a leadership development program that was really an organizational development program. We worked with the founder on delegation, strategic leadership versus operational involvement, and building a team that could own outcomes not just execute tasks. We coached the leadership team on managing complexity, leading through influence, making decisions with incomplete information, and having difficult conversations about trade-offs and accountability.

We established operating rhythms (quarterly strategy reviews, monthly leadership meetings, weekly cross-functional standups) that created predictability and clarity. We facilitated sessions where leaders practiced navigating conflict and ambiguity constructively. We helped them build capabilities in strategic planning, talent development, and organizational design.

The turning point came when a major manufacturing disruption hit overseas and the leadership team handled it without the founder's involvement—they assessed impact, made trade-offs between delivery commitments and cost, communicated transparently with customers and retail partners, and solved it. The founder told us: "That's when I knew we'd built a leadership team that could grow the business, not just run it."

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value

**Scenario 1: DTC Growth Without Destroying Wholesale Relationships**

A $120M outdoor apparel brand had built their business through specialty retail partnerships. As DTC grew to 30% of revenue, tensions with retail partners escalated. Retailers complained about being undercut on pricing and receiving inventory after DTC orders were fulfilled. The DTC team complained that wholesale commitments limited their ability to serve direct customers. Sales and marketing were essentially two separate companies competing for resources.

This wasn't a pricing strategy problem or a channel strategy problem. It was an organizational alignment problem disguised as channel conflict.

We used ONA to understand actual decision-making patterns and information flows (spoiler: very little coordination between channels). We facilitated sessions where wholesale and DTC leaders mapped customer journeys and identified where competition was destroying total company value. We redesigned organizational structure, incentives, and decision rights so leaders were rewarded for total company performance, not channel performance.

We established frameworks for inventory allocation, pricing strategy, and product launches that balanced channel needs based on profitability and strategic importance. We created communication protocols with retail partners that were transparent about the DTC business while demonstrating continued commitment to wholesale success.

Within a year, wholesale revenue was growing again (up 8% after two years of flat growth), DTC revenue continued growing (up 35%), retail partner satisfaction scores recovered, and the leadership team was collaborating instead of fighting over resources. They learned that omnichannel isn't a channel strategy—it's an organizational capability.

**Scenario 2: Post-Acquisition Integration That Preserves Brand Authenticity**

A $180M sporting goods company acquired a $30M boutique outdoor brand beloved by enthusiasts for authentic community connection and environmental commitment. The acquisition thesis was sound: access to passionate customer base, premium positioning, product design expertise. Nine months later, the acquired brand's community was alienated, social media engagement had crashed, and sales were declining.

What happened? The parent company tried to "professionalize" the brand by imposing their marketing calendars, product planning processes, approval hierarchies, and vendor requirements. All reasonable from a scale and efficiency perspective. All culture-destroying from an authenticity and community perspective.

We facilitated integration design workshops where leaders from both organizations actually listened to each other's perspectives and co-created new ways of working. We identified where the acquired brand needed autonomy (community engagement, product vision, marketing voice) and where integration added value (supply chain scale, manufacturing relationships, compliance).

We coached parent company leaders on managing through outcomes instead of processes, and acquired brand leaders on operating with transparency that builds trust. We created cross-brand learning mechanisms so the parent company could learn community building and authentic marketing while the acquired brand could benefit from supply chain scale and retail distribution.

Two years later, the acquired brand had returned to growth, community engagement metrics exceeded pre-acquisition levels, and they'd co-created product collaborations that successfully bridged both brands' communities. The integration went from crisis to model.

**Scenario 3: Supply Chain Transformation for Resilience and Sustainability**

A sporting goods manufacturer needed to fundamentally reshape their supply chain. Geopolitical tensions were disrupting established manufacturing relationships. Tariff uncertainty was creating cost volatility. Consumer demand for sustainability was mounting. They needed to diversify manufacturing, improve visibility, and shift toward more sustainable materials—all while maintaining quality, delivery performance, and managing costs.

This wasn't a supply chain optimization project. It was an organizational transformation requiring Supply Chain, Product Development, Quality, Manufacturing Coordination, and Finance to fundamentally change how they worked together.

We didn't start with a supply chain strategy (they had that). We started with organizational design: What new capabilities did they need? What decision-making frameworks would enable speed and flexibility? What processes needed to change? What behaviors needed to shift?

We created cross-functional teams to tackle specific challenges—nearshoring pilots, new supplier development, quality assurance for sustainable materials, cost modeling. We established governance so decisions got made instead of endlessly debated. We coached leaders on managing transformation while maintaining operations.

Eighteen months later, they'd diversified manufacturing across four countries (previously concentrated in two), reduced lead times by 35%, improved on-time delivery from 79% to 92%, and actually reduced costs by 6% through efficiency gains. More importantly, they'd built organizational capability to continue evolving their supply chain as conditions changed instead of requiring consultants for every shift.

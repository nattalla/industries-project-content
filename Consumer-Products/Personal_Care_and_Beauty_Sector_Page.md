## Industry Context
*Navigating market saturation and the sustainability reckoning*

The beauty and personal care industry is experiencing its first real identity crisis in a decade. After years of seemingly insatiable consumer appetite for newness and robust pricing growth—with the sector growing 7% annually from 2022 to 2024—the rules of engagement have fundamentally changed.

Geopolitical uncertainty, market saturation, and evolving consumer preferences now threaten that growth trajectory. The beauty market is still growing, but where it grows and how companies win is shifting dramatically. Online channels are expected to account for nearly one-third of global beauty sales by 2030 (up from 26% in 2024), the highest share of any channel. Meanwhile, traditional channels like department stores and drugstores could see their share decline.

For mid-market beauty and personal care companies, the challenges run deeper than channel shifts. While 76% of consumer goods executives say their company embraces a circular economy model, many struggle to translate sustainability commitments into operational reality. The European Union's Green Claims Directive, which came into force in 2024, requires companies to provide evidence supporting environmental assertions—and many personal care companies don't keep product information in centralized locations, turning compliance into a logistical nightmare.

Add to this mix: cybersecurity threats, regulatory pressures across plastics and product formulation, the rising complexity of global supply chains where 52% of brands identify visibility as a top priority, and labor challenges that continue to squeeze margins. The beauty industry isn't just dealing with market dynamics—it's dealing with organizational capability gaps that strategy alone can't fix.

## Common Operational Challenges

Beauty and personal care leaders didn't start their companies to manage organizational complexity. But that's exactly what threatens to derail their growth plans.

**Regulatory compliance without clear ownership.** When the Green Claims Directive passed, teams scrambled to inventory every environmental claim made across packaging, marketing, and advertising. Many companies discovered they had no single source of truth for product information—data lived in marketing files, supplier spreadsheets, and email inboxes. The deadline created panic not because companies lacked the information, but because no one owned coordinating it across functions.

**Supply chain visibility problems masquerading as technology problems.** Companies invest in supply chain management tools to track ingredients, production, and distribution, yet still experience stockouts and delays. The real issue often isn't the technology—it's that procurement, manufacturing, quality, and logistics teams operate in silos with different priorities, systems, and communication cadences. The tools show you where things are; they don't make people coordinate better.

**Innovation bottlenecks disguised as process gaps.** Product development should take 6 months but actually takes 12. It's not because R&D is slow—it's because formulation, regulatory, marketing, and ops all have different definitions of "ready to launch," decisions get remade multiple times, and no one has clear authority to make trade-offs. Every delay costs money and opportunity.

**Post-acquisition cultural integration failures.** The beauty industry saw significant M&A activity as companies acquire smaller brands to diversify portfolios and reach new demographics. The deal math works, but then six months later, the acquired brand's innovation engine stalls because they're drowning in parent company processes, key talent starts leaving, and the very entrepreneurial culture that made the brand attractive gets crushed under corporate structure.

## Where Executives Get Stuck

These are the things beauty and personal care leaders tell us in discovery conversations:

"We talk about being 'purpose-driven' and 'sustainability-first' in every board meeting, but when it comes to actually changing how we work—reformulating products, redesigning packaging, updating supply chain practices—we can't seem to get alignment. Everyone agrees in the room, but nothing happens after."

"We acquired a challenger brand that was growing 40% year-over-year. They had 30 people and moved fast. We tried to 'integrate' them into our systems and processes, and now their growth has stalled. We're killing the very thing we paid for."

"Our DTC channel is growing, our retail partnerships are strong, and our product pipeline is solid. But our operations team, marketing team, and sales team might as well be three different companies. They use different data, have different priorities, and spend more time fighting than collaborating. The CEO keeps telling everyone to 'break down silos,' but it's not working."

"We need to be more agile—faster product development, quicker responses to trends, better inventory management. We've hired 'agile coaches' and sent people to training. But our culture rewards not making mistakes over moving fast, and our approval processes have 47 steps. The training didn't change any of that."

These aren't marketing problems or R&D problems or supply chain problems. They're organizational effectiveness problems—and they require organizational solutions.

## How Rooted Helps Personal Care & Beauty Leaders

### Organizational Network Analysis (ONA): Understanding Your Hidden Operating System

A beauty brand with $150M in revenue knew their product development was slow but couldn't figure out why. Meetings were full, people were busy, leadership kept saying "we need to move faster," but cycle times weren't improving.

We used ONA to map how decisions, information, and approvals actually moved through the organization. The results surprised them. The "collaborative culture" they thought they had was actually highly fragmented. Teams were collaborating intensely within functions (R&D with R&D, Marketing with Marketing) but barely at all across functions. Three middle managers had become unintentional gatekeepers—every decision flowed through them, creating massive bottlenecks.

We redesigned their product development approach around cross-functional pods with clear decision rights, reduced approval layers, and created direct connections between the people who actually needed to work together. Product development cycle time dropped from 14 months to 8 months. The company didn't hire more people or invest in new tools—they just started working the way they needed to work.

### Organizational Change Management (OCM): Making Sustainability Real, Not Just Aspirational

A personal care company committed to eliminating 50% of virgin plastic from packaging within three years. The sustainability team had a plan. The supply chain team said it was impossible. Marketing worried about consumer perception. Finance questioned the ROI. Eighteen months in, they'd achieved 8% reduction and tensions were high.

We facilitated structured working sessions where each function laid out their real constraints and concerns—not polite versions, the real ones. We created a cross-functional team with dedicated time and clear accountability for solving specific packaging challenges. We established metrics everyone agreed to and built feedback loops so problems got escalated and solved rather than ignored.

Just as importantly, we coached the executive team on what change leadership actually requires—not just speeches about purpose, but making tough resource allocation decisions, removing blockers, and visibly reinforcing new behaviors. They hit their three-year target in 28 months, and the organization learned how to tackle complex cross-functional challenges instead of just talking about them.

### Business Process Engineering (BPE): Designing Workflows That Match How Beauty Really Works

A cosmetics manufacturer was drowning in SKU complexity. Over years of growth, they'd accumulated 847 active SKUs with dozens being introduced and discontinued quarterly. The demand planning team couldn't forecast accurately. Manufacturing struggled with changeovers. Distribution centers were overwhelmed. Everyone knew it was a problem, but every brand manager fought to keep their SKUs alive.

We didn't start with a process map. We started by understanding the organizational dynamics—why keeping marginal SKUs felt safer than discontinuing them, how success was measured (spoiler: not profitability), and who had real influence over portfolio decisions versus who was supposed to have influence.

Then we redesigned the product lifecycle management process to include clear gates, profitability thresholds, and decision rights. We created a monthly portfolio review process owned by a cross-functional team, not a brand management free-for-all. We built analytics that made SKU profitability transparent to everyone.

They discontinued 200 underperforming SKUs in six months. Forecast accuracy improved by 31%. Manufacturing efficiency jumped. And brand managers started proposing discontinuations themselves because the process made the data undeniable.

### Organizational Development & Effectiveness (OD&E): Building Leaders Who Can Scale

A beauty startup had grown from $10M to $80M in four years through product innovation and social media marketing. The founder was brilliant at brand building and product development. The leadership team—all early employees promoted into roles—were great at execution but drowning as the company scaled. The organization was hitting the wall of founder-led decision-making on everything.

We designed a leadership development program that was really an organizational development program. We worked with the founder on delegation and letting go. We coached the leadership team on strategic thinking, decision-making frameworks, and managing without micromanaging. We established operating rhythms (quarterly planning, monthly leadership reviews, weekly check-ins) that created predictability and clarity.

The turning point came when the founder left for a two-week vacation and didn't check email once—because the team knew what to do and had the authority to do it. The company hit $100M the following year, and the founder told us: "You didn't just develop my leaders. You helped me transition from founder to CEO."

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value

**Scenario 1: DTC Growth That Doesn't Break Operations**

A skincare brand built on Amazon and DTC channels was growing 60% annually. Amazing, right? Except operations couldn't keep up. Inventory planning was chaotic—constant stockouts on best-sellers, excess inventory on slow movers. Customer service was overwhelmed. Fulfillment errors were climbing. The founder knew they needed to "professionalize" operations but didn't want to lose the scrappy, responsive culture that made them successful.

We used ONA to understand how decisions actually got made (spoiler: everything went through the founder and two operations managers who were working 80-hour weeks). We redesigned workflows to push decision-making down to team leads, established inventory planning processes that used data instead of gut feel, and created clear escalation paths for exceptions.

We helped them hire an operations director and coached that person on preserving culture while adding structure—not easy, but essential. Within six months, on-time fulfillment went from 73% to 96%, stockouts dropped by 65%, and the founder was working 50-hour weeks instead of 70. Growth continued at 50%+ with half the operational chaos.

**Scenario 2: Acquisition Integration That Doesn't Destroy Innovation**

A $200M personal care company acquired a $25M "clean beauty" brand beloved by millennials. The acquisition thesis was solid: expand into a growing category, gain technical expertise in natural formulations, access a new customer demographic. Six months later, the acquired brand's founders were miserable, three key formulators had resigned, and product development had ground to a halt.

What happened? The parent company tried to "help" by imposing their stage-gate process, compliance requirements, and reporting cadences. All reasonable from a corporate governance perspective, all culture-killing from an innovation perspective.

We facilitated integration design workshops where both teams co-created new ways of working that balanced governance with autonomy. We established clear boundaries—where the acquired brand had freedom to operate independently (formulation, brand marketing, product development) and where they needed to integrate (supply chain, compliance, finance). We coached the parent company's leaders on managing through outcomes instead of processes.

The turning point came when they launched a co-created product that blended the acquired brand's natural formulation expertise with the parent company's scale and distribution. It became the fastest-growing product in the portfolio, and the integration became a model instead of a cautionary tale.

**Scenario 3: Sustainability Transformation That's Operational, Not Just Aspirational**

A beauty company made ambitious sustainability commitments: carbon neutral by 2030, 100% recyclable packaging by 2027, responsible sourcing for all ingredients by 2026. The press release was great. The execution plan was 40 PowerPoint slides that no one really understood how to implement.

We worked with them to translate aspirations into operational reality. We mapped their current state across the value chain, identified specific interventions with clear owners and timelines, and designed measurement systems that made progress visible and transparent.

More importantly, we helped them build organizational capability to deliver on sustainability—not through a separate sustainability team but by embedding sustainability into how Product Development, Supply Chain, and Operations actually worked. We created incentive structures that rewarded sustainable choices and removed organizational barriers that made unsustainable options seem easier.

Two years later, they were ahead of schedule on all major milestones, had avoided $3M in compliance penalties from the Green Claims Directive, and turned sustainability from a "nice to have" into a competitive advantage that customers and employees genuinely believed in.

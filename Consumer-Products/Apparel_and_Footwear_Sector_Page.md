## Industry Context
*An industry redefining itself amid transformation pressures*

The apparel and footwear industry isn't just facing challenges in 2025—it's fundamentally redefining itself. The global apparel market reached $2.25 trillion in 2024, but growth projections for 2025 remain low at just 2-4%, a dramatic slowdown from pre-pandemic expansion rates. This isn't a temporary blip. It's a structural shift driven by inflation pressures, geopolitical tensions, evolving consumer expectations around sustainability, and digital transformation that's reshaping how products are designed, manufactured, and sold.

For mid-market apparel and footwear companies, the challenge is stark: adapt how you operate or fall behind. According to The Interline's 2025 Fashion Technology Research Report, 80% of fashion professionals now use industry-specific technology tools daily or weekly, and 90% believe 3D and digital product creation tools will transform operations within the next year. Meanwhile, 71% of shoppers say they plan to keep their clothes longer, the resale market is projected to reach $350 billion by 2028, and consumers demand both sustainability and value in a market where over 50% of fashion executives have already raised prices.

The operational pressures are intense and multifaceted: supply chain disruptions continue (even post-pandemic), with geopolitical tensions driving further shifts; cybersecurity threats mount as brands expand digital footprints (the average cost of a data breach in retail hit $4.88 million in 2024); labor shortages persist, particularly in skilled positions; and e-commerce return rates have spiked to 20.8%, up 96% since 2020, creating reverse logistics nightmares.

Mid-market fashion companies can't simply copy what larger competitors do—they don't have the same resources or risk tolerance. But they also can't ignore these industry-wide transformations. Success requires building organizational capability to move faster, adapt to changing market conditions, and execute complex transformation initiatives while maintaining day-to-day operations.

## Common Operational Challenges

Fashion executives live in the world of trends, design, and brand building. But the problems that actually limit growth live in organizational effectiveness and execution capability.

**Digital transformation that stalls at adoption.** Companies invest in PLM systems, demand forecasting tools, supply chain visibility platforms, and omnichannel commerce infrastructure. But technology implementation without organizational change management creates expensive shelfware. Teams revert to spreadsheets and emails because "the new system is too complicated" or "doesn't fit how we work." The problem isn't the technology—it's that no one redesigned workflows, addressed adoption barriers, or helped people understand why changing how they work matters.

**Supply chain complexity without coordination mechanisms.** Apparel and footwear supply chains are among the most complex in consumer products—raw materials sourced globally, manufacturing spread across multiple countries and vendors, inventory distributed across channels, with fast fashion cycles demanding speed and flexibility. Companies have invested in supply chain technology, but tools don't create coordination. Different functions still optimize locally rather than holistically, creating endless firefighting over stockouts, excess inventory, and delivery delays.

**Post-acquisition integration that destroys value.** Fashion M&A activity remains robust as companies acquire brands to diversify portfolios, access new demographics, or gain capabilities. But acquisition integration in fashion is uniquely challenging because brand identity and creative culture are core to value creation. Trying to impose parent company processes and systems on an acquired brand often kills the very entrepreneurial energy and speed that made the brand attractive in the first place. Integration requires balancing governance with autonomy—something most companies struggle to do.

**Sustainability commitments without execution frameworks.** The industry talks endlessly about sustainability, circularity, and responsible sourcing. Some companies make bold commitments that look great in press releases but lack operational roadmaps. Others know what needs to change but can't get alignment across functions—design wants innovation, procurement wants cost control, manufacturing wants efficiency, and sustainability wants environmental impact reduction. Without clear decision rights and trade-off frameworks, progress stalls.

## Where Executives Get Stuck

Here's what apparel and footwear leaders tell us when they first reach out:

"We acquired a direct-to-consumer brand that was growing 80% annually with 25 employees. We wanted to scale them with our infrastructure and capabilities. Instead, we've slowed them down. Their design team is frustrated by our approval processes. Their marketing team misses our planning cycles. Key talent is leaving. We're losing what we paid for."

"Everyone agrees we need to be more agile—faster product development, quicker response to trends, better inventory management. We've sent people to 'agile training' and hired consultants to teach us new methodologies. But our culture still rewards not making mistakes over moving fast, and our approval processes still have 47 steps. The training hasn't changed any of that."

"We know we need to get serious about sustainability. Consumers are asking about it, investors are pushing us, regulations are coming. But when we try to change sourcing practices, redesign products for circularity, or shift to more sustainable materials, we get stuck. Procurement says it's too expensive. Design says sustainable materials don't perform. Manufacturing says it disrupts production. Everyone has valid concerns, but no one can make a decision."

"Our supply chain team, merchandising team, and operations team might as well be three different companies. They use different forecasts, have different priorities, and communicate primarily by pointing fingers when things go wrong. We keep talking about 'collaboration' and 'breaking down silos,' but nothing actually changes."

These aren't design problems or merchandising problems or supply chain problems. They're organizational capability gaps that strategy alone can't close.

## How Rooted Helps Apparel & Footwear Leaders

### Organizational Network Analysis (ONA): Understanding How Your Organization Really Works

A $250M apparel company knew they had a product development problem—new styles took 14 months from concept to shelf when competitors were doing it in 9 months. They assumed the issue was their design team being slow or their approval process having too many steps.

We used ONA to map how decisions, information, and collaboration actually happened across product development. The reality was more complex than "design is slow." Design, merchandising, sourcing, and production planning were communicating through formal channels (scheduled meetings and email) that created delays, but barely collaborating informally. Three senior leaders had become unintentional bottlenecks—every decision escalated to them because no one else had clear authority to make trade-offs.

More surprisingly, the company had talented mid-level managers who were already solving problems informally and creating unofficial workarounds to speed things up—but this happened in the shadows, not as part of the official process.

We didn't reorganize. We redesigned product development to push decision-making to cross-functional teams with clear authority, reduced approval layers, formalized the informal relationships that were already working, and coached leaders on getting out of the decision path for routine trade-offs. Product development cycle time dropped from 14 months to 9.5 months. They hired zero new people and bought zero new technology—they just started working the way they needed to work.

### Organizational Change Management (OCM): Making Transformation Real, Not Just Talked About

An athletic footwear brand committed to a major sustainability transformation: shift 60% of materials to recycled or bio-based alternatives within three years, achieve carbon neutrality in operations, and design all products for end-of-life recyclability.

The sustainability team had a detailed plan. Then reality hit. Design pushed back on material constraints. Procurement worried about supply reliability and cost. Manufacturing flagged production complexity. Retail questioned consumer willingness to pay premium prices. Twelve months in, they'd achieved 8% material conversion and tensions were high.

We didn't create another plan. We facilitated structured sessions where each function laid out their real constraints and concerns—not sanitized versions, the real ones. We created cross-functional working teams to solve specific challenges (like finding scalable recycled material suppliers or redesigning flagship products for sustainability without performance trade-offs). We established clear metrics everyone agreed to and built feedback loops so problems surfaced and got solved rather than ignored.

Critically, we coached the executive team on what transformation actually requires: making hard resource allocation decisions, removing organizational barriers, addressing people who actively resist, and visibly reinforcing the behaviors that support the change. They hit their three-year target in 32 months, turned sustainability from a talking point into a competitive advantage, and built organizational capability to tackle complex cross-functional initiatives.

### Business Process Engineering (BPE): Designing Operations for Speed and Flexibility

A contemporary apparel brand was growing fast through DTC and specialty retail channels, but operations were breaking. Inventory management was chaotic—constant stockouts on best-sellers, overstock on slow movers. Order fulfillment was inconsistent. Product launches were delayed by operational bottlenecks. The COO knew they needed to "fix our processes" but wasn't sure where to start.

We didn't start with process mapping. We started by understanding what was actually blocking execution. Through observation and interviews with inventory planners, fulfillment managers, customer service reps, and merchandisers, we discovered the real issue: each function had optimized their own processes without considering downstream impacts.

Merchandising created assortment plans based on creative vision without understanding operational constraints. Inventory planning used forecasting models that didn't account for lead time variability. Fulfillment optimized for efficiency (batch picking, consolidation) at the expense of speed and accuracy. Everyone was working hard, but the handoffs between functions created chaos.

We redesigned the inventory-to-fulfillment process holistically, starting with customer delivery requirements and working backward. We created integrated planning processes where Merchandising, Planning, and Operations made decisions together rather than sequentially. We established decision frameworks for trade-offs based on customer impact and profitability, not functional preferences.

On-time fulfillment jumped from 76% to 94%. Stockouts dropped by 60%. Product launch delays fell by 70%. And the operations team stopped firefighting and started improving, because the processes were designed for how the business actually worked.

### Organizational Development & Effectiveness (OD&E): Building Leadership That Can Navigate Complexity

A footwear company had grown from a niche outdoor brand to a $200M lifestyle brand through product line expansion and channel diversification. The founder was a brilliant designer and brand builder. The leadership team—all early employees promoted into roles—were excellent executors but struggling to lead at scale. Strategy execution was slow. Cross-functional initiatives stalled. The founder was involved in every decision and was burning out.

We designed a leadership development program that was really an organizational development program. We worked with the founder on delegation, letting go, and transitioning from operator to strategist. We coached the leadership team on strategic thinking, managing complexity, leading through influence, and making decisions without perfect information.

We established operating rhythms (quarterly strategy reviews, monthly leadership meetings, weekly cross-functional check-ins) that created predictability and pushed decision-making down. We facilitated sessions where leaders practiced having difficult conversations about trade-offs, resources, and accountability.

The turning point came when a major supply chain disruption hit and the leadership team handled it without the founder—they assessed the situation, made trade-offs, communicated transparently with customers and partners, and solved it. The founder told us: "That's when I knew we'd built a leadership team that could scale the business, not just run it."

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value

**Scenario 1: Acquisition Integration That Preserves Brand Value**

A $180M contemporary apparel company acquired a $35M streetwear brand beloved by Gen Z consumers. The acquisition thesis was sound: access a growing demographic, gain street cred, learn from their social-first marketing approach. Nine months later, the streetwear brand's founder had left, two key designers had followed, and sales were declining.

What happened? The parent company tried to "help" by bringing the acquired brand onto their systems, imposing their planning calendars, requiring their reporting cadences, and applying their approval processes. All reasonable from a governance perspective, all culture-killing from a creative perspective.

We facilitated integration design workshops where leaders from both organizations co-created new ways of working. We identified where the acquired brand needed autonomy (design, marketing, product development) and where integration made sense (supply chain, finance, compliance). We coached parent company leaders on managing through outcomes instead of processes, and acquired brand leaders on operating with transparency that builds trust.

We established cross-brand learning mechanisms so the parent company could actually learn from the acquired brand's social media mastery and speed, while the acquired brand could benefit from the parent's supply chain scale and retail relationships.

Two years later, the streetwear brand had returned to growth, key talent had stayed, and they'd co-created a capsule collection that was the fastest-growing product line in the combined company. The integration went from disaster track to proof point.

**Scenario 2: Supply Chain Transformation That Balances Speed, Cost, and Sustainability**

An athletic footwear brand needed to fundamentally reshape their supply chain. Consumer demand was shifting faster than ever. Sustainability pressure was mounting. Geopolitical tensions were disrupting long-established manufacturing relationships. They needed to move production closer to key markets (nearshoring), diversify suppliers, and improve visibility—all while maintaining quality and managing costs.

This wasn't a supply chain optimization project. It was an organizational transformation project that required Supply Chain, Product Development, Procurement, Quality, and Finance to completely change how they worked together.

We didn't start with a new supply chain strategy (they had that). We started with organizational design: What new capabilities did they need? What decision-making frameworks would enable speed and flexibility? What processes needed to change? What behaviors needed to shift?

We created cross-functional transformation teams to tackle specific challenges—nearshoring pilots, supplier diversification strategy, quality assurance for new vendors, cost modeling for sustainability materials. We established clear governance so decisions got made instead of debated endlessly. We coached leaders on managing transformation while maintaining operations.

Eighteen months later, they'd shifted 35% of production to nearshore facilities (target was 30%), reduced lead times by 40%, improved on-time delivery from 81% to 93%, and actually reduced costs by 8% through efficiency gains that offset higher nearshore labor costs. More importantly, they'd built organizational capability to continue evolving their supply chain as market conditions changed.

**Scenario 3: Digital Transformation That Drives Business Results**

A heritage apparel brand needed to transform from a primarily wholesale business to a digital-first, omnichannel model. They'd invested in e-commerce platforms, demand forecasting tools, and customer data systems. But two years in, DTC revenue was flat, digital tools were underutilized, and the organization was exhausted from change initiatives that hadn't delivered results.

The problem wasn't technology. The technology worked fine. The problem was that the organization hadn't changed how it worked. Merchandising still planned for wholesale rhythms. Marketing still thought in seasonal campaigns. Operations was still optimized for bulk shipments to retailers, not individual DTC orders. Everyone was working hard, but working in ways designed for the old business model.

We didn't implement more technology. We redesigned how Merchandising, Marketing, and Operations worked together for a digital-first business. We created DTC-specific planning processes. We established new decision-making frameworks for inventory allocation between wholesale and DTC. We built feedback loops so teams learned from customer data and responded quickly.

We also coached the leadership team on leading transformation—not just announcing strategies, but removing barriers, addressing resistance, celebrating wins, and holding people accountable for changing behaviors.

DTC revenue grew 60% the following year. More importantly, the organization learned how to continuously adapt to changing market conditions instead of requiring consultants to tell them what to do.

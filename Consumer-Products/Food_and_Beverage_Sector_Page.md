## Industry Context
*Current market dynamics and organizational pressures*

The food and beverage industry is experiencing what industry leaders are calling a "reset moment." After years of passing rising costs directly to consumers through aggressive pricing strategies, that playbook stopped working in 2024. Global retail sales value for consumer products rose 7.5% year-over-year in 2024, down from 9.3% growth in 2023, as price increases ran their course and volume growth remained modest.

Mid-market food and beverage companies now face a complex balancing act. Manufacturers warn of unpredictable conditions ahead, with 14 of the world's largest food and beverage companies citing inflationary pressure, supply chain volatility, and shifting consumer behavior as their primary concerns for 2025. Meanwhile, 70% of food manufacturers reported labor shortages in 2024, with estimates suggesting these shortages could reach 65,000 workers by 2025.

The pressure isn't just external. Organizations are grappling with internal transformation challenges that most executives didn't see coming. Companies that successfully navigated the pandemic by raising prices now find themselves needing to fundamentally reshape operations to drive profitable volume growth—and they're discovering their organizational structures, processes, and networks weren't built for this shift.

## Common Operational Challenges

Food and beverage leaders know their products. What keeps them up at night is whether their organizations can actually execute the transformations they need.

**Digital transformation friction.** Nearly 50% of food and beverage executives cite the need to improve production efficiencies and the ability to gather and analyze data for decision-making as top drivers for digital transformation investment. The problem isn't technology adoption—it's that legacy organizational structures, siloed departments, and resistance to new workflows create implementation bottlenecks that drain time and money.

**Supply chain complexity without visibility.** Companies have invested millions in supply chain technology, yet many still struggle with basic coordination. When ingredients are sourced globally, manufacturing happens regionally, and distribution is fragmented, even sophisticated systems fail if the people using them don't communicate effectively or understand their interdependencies.

**Post-M&A integration failures.** Multiple leading manufacturers highlight transformation risks and organizational complexity as areas of focus as they aim to build leaner, faster business models. When companies acquire to fill portfolio gaps or gain scale, they often discover that merging different organizational cultures, systems, and ways of working is harder than the deal itself.

**Compliance and regulatory coordination breakdowns.** Many companies struggled to build compliance operations for complex regulations, with implementation spanning six months or longer due to difficulties developing internal policies, establishing reporting protocols, and implementing new workflows. These aren't just policy problems—they're organizational communication problems disguised as compliance issues.

## Where Executives Get Stuck

Here's what we hear from food and beverage executives in their first conversations with us:

"We have the strategy. We know we need to shift from price increases to volume growth with better mix. Our board is aligned. But when we try to execute, it's like pushing a rope. Different parts of the organization are pulling in different directions, and we can't figure out why."

"We've invested heavily in analytics and forecasting tools, but decisions still get made based on who shouts loudest in the room rather than what the data says. Our planning cycles take twice as long as they should because of internal politics."

"We acquired a regional brand 18 months ago to expand our product portfolio. The deal made perfect sense on paper. But the integration has been brutal—our teams don't trust each other, information doesn't flow, and we're still running on two separate operating systems."

"Everyone says they want to be 'data-driven' and 'agile,' but when we actually try to change how we work, we hit a wall. Middle management says they support the changes, but somehow nothing actually changes."

These aren't strategy problems. They're organizational effectiveness problems—and they're exactly what Rooted was built to solve.

## How Rooted Helps Food & Beverage Leaders

### Organizational Network Analysis (ONA): Seeing How Work Actually Happens

The org chart says your supply chain and R&D teams should be collaborating to improve product formulations and reduce costs. ONA shows you they barely talk to each other, and that all communication flows through two overloaded managers who've become bottlenecks.

For a mid-market beverage manufacturer struggling with product innovation delays, we used ONA to map how information and decisions actually moved through their organization. The executive team assumed their matrix structure was creating collaboration across functions. Instead, we discovered the matrix had created confusion about decision rights, with product launches delayed by an average of 8 weeks because no one knew who was actually responsible for approvals. 

We identified informal leaders who were already solving problems across silos and helped the company redesign accountabilities around how work actually flowed. Product launch cycles shortened by 35%, and the team finally had clarity about who owned what.

### Organizational Change Management (OCM): Making Transformation Stick

A regional snack food company needed to integrate a recent acquisition while simultaneously implementing new ERP and demand planning systems. Their IT team had a perfect technical implementation plan. What they didn't have was a plan for getting 450 people across two legacy organizations to actually change how they worked.

We designed and executed a change management program that went beyond typical "communication plans and training." We identified change champions in both organizations, created peer-to-peer learning networks, addressed the unspoken fears about redundancies, and built feedback loops so leadership could course-correct in real time.

The result: They achieved 82% user adoption within 90 days of go-live—well above the industry average of 50-60%—and maintained operational performance throughout the integration instead of the typical 6-month productivity dip.

### Business Process Engineering (BPE): Designing Operations That Actually Work

When a frozen food manufacturer told us they wanted to "improve efficiency," we could have run a typical process mapping exercise and delivered a binder of optimized workflows that would sit on a shelf. Instead, we asked: What's actually slowing you down?

Through process discovery sessions with frontline teams, we found the real issue wasn't the processes themselves—it was that processes designed for six distribution centers were breaking down now that they had 18 after several acquisitions. Information handoffs that worked in a smaller organization were creating delays and errors at scale.

We redesigned their order-to-delivery process with input from the people actually doing the work, eliminated 23 non-value-added steps, and created decision-making frameworks that empowered regional managers to solve problems without escalating to headquarters. Order fulfillment time dropped from 72 hours to 48 hours, and error rates fell by 40%.

### Organizational Development & Effectiveness (OD&E): Building Capability That Lasts

A specialty coffee roaster had grown from a single facility to five regional operations through acquisitions. Their biggest challenge wasn't strategy or capital—it was that their leadership team had never managed a distributed organization before, and each acquired facility had its own way of doing things.

We designed a leadership development program that wasn't about sending executives to generic workshops. Instead, we created action-learning projects where cross-site leadership teams worked on real business challenges—like standardizing quality processes across facilities—while we coached them on leading through influence, managing conflict, and making decisions with incomplete information.

Six months later, they had both solved real operational issues and developed leaders who could actually run a multi-site organization. That capability was worth more than any process document.

## Why Mid-Market Leaders Work With Rooted

The Big Five consulting firms will send a team of bright people to analyze your business and deliver a deck with recommendations. Rooted is different.

We don't just tell you what to do—we work alongside your team to build organizational capability so you can sustain the changes after we leave. We focus on how work actually happens, not how the org chart says it should happen. And we don't bring cookie-cutter frameworks—we adapt our approach to your specific context, culture, and constraints.

Mid-market food and beverage companies choose Rooted because:
- We understand the unique pressures of growing mid-market companies—you need to move fast but can't afford expensive mistakes
- We've been operators and leaders ourselves, not just consultants—we know what it's like to implement change, not just recommend it
- We deliver measurable outcomes quickly, not multi-year transformation programs that never seem to end
- We build internal capability so you're not dependent on consultants forever

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value

**Scenario 1: Post-Acquisition Integration That Actually Works**
A $300M regional food manufacturer acquired a competitor to gain market share and product diversity. Six months post-close, the integration was struggling. The acquired company's sales team refused to use the parent company's CRM, supply chain systems weren't talking to each other, and customers were getting inconsistent service.

Rooted used ONA to identify the informal relationships and communication patterns that were actually making things work (or not work). We discovered the acquired company had three employees who were trusted bridges between the organizations, but they were overwhelmed and burning out. We designed a structured integration approach that used these connectors strategically while building broader organizational connections. We facilitated working sessions where teams from both companies co-designed new processes instead of having processes imposed top-down. 

Within four months, system adoption reached 90%, customer satisfaction scores recovered to pre-acquisition levels, and the company captured the projected cost synergies 18 months ahead of schedule.

**Scenario 2: Turning Digital Transformation Investment Into Results**
A craft beverage company invested $2M in demand forecasting and production planning software. After eight months, utilization was less than 30%, and planners were still using Excel spreadsheets because "the new system was too complicated." The CEO was frustrated—not with the technology, but with the lack of adoption.

We ran a BPE engagement focused on workflow redesign, not software training. We worked with planners to redesign their planning processes around the new system's capabilities instead of trying to replicate old workflows in new technology. We created quick-win use cases that showed immediate value, identified and removed organizational barriers to adoption (like managers who undermined the change), and coached the planning team on new ways of working.

Ninety days later, system utilization hit 85%, forecast accuracy improved by 22%, and inventory carrying costs dropped by 15%. More importantly, the planning team became advocates for the system instead of resistors.

**Scenario 3: Breaking Down Silos That Block Growth**
A specialty foods manufacturer had sales growing 15% annually but couldn't scale operations to keep up. The problem wasn't capacity—they had plenty of equipment. The problem was that Sales, Operations, and R&D functioned as separate fiefdoms. New product launches took 9 months because of endless back-and-forth. Rush orders created chaos in production. Communication happened through email chains where people got defensive rather than solving problems.

We used ONA to map the actual collaboration patterns (spoiler: there weren't many) and facilitated sessions where leaders from each function actually talked about what was blocking execution. We redesigned the product development process to include Operations and R&D from day one instead of having Sales throw requirements over the wall. We established cross-functional teams with clear decision rights and accountability.

New product cycle time dropped from 9 months to 5 months. On-time delivery improved from 78% to 94%. And most importantly, the leadership team started solving problems together instead of pointing fingers.

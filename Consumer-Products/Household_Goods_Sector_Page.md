## Industry Context
*Balancing growth, sustainability, and operational complexity*

The household cleaning products industry sits at an interesting crossroads. The market reached $270 billion globally in 2024 and is projected to grow to $380 billion by 2032 at a CAGR of 4.4%. That sounds great until you realize the growth is masking significant organizational stress beneath the surface.

The COVID pandemic permanently changed consumer behavior around hygiene and cleanliness, creating sustained demand that most companies weren't organizationally prepared to meet. Supply chain challenges that characterized early pandemic days have largely resolved, but the industry now faces a different set of pressures: rising transportation and labor costs, increasing demand for eco-friendly products (the natural/organic segment is growing faster than chemical-based despite representing only 14% of the market), and intensifying competition as private-label brands capture market share through aggressive pricing.

For mid-market household goods companies, the challenge isn't market size or opportunity—it's execution capability. Companies that successfully increased production capacity during pandemic-driven demand now face margin pressure and need to become fundamentally more efficient. Those pursuing growth through acquisition are discovering that integrating companies with different systems, cultures, and processes is harder than the deal itself. Those investing in sustainability are finding that commitments made in boardrooms are difficult to operationalize across complex supply chains.

The global household cleaning products market is highly competitive, with companies working on new product launches and strategic partnerships to expand market share. Success increasingly depends not just on having good products, but on having an organization that can execute strategy faster and more effectively than competitors.

## Common Operational Challenges

Household goods executives spend most of their time thinking about products, formulations, and go-to-market strategies. But the problems that actually limit growth are organizational.

**Sustainability commitments without operational roadmaps.** Europe's regulations around biodegradability and the push toward natural products create real pressure. Companies make ambitious commitments—eliminate single-use plastics, transition to plant-based ingredients, reduce carbon footprint 50% by 2030—then discover that Procurement, R&D, Manufacturing, and Supply Chain all interpret "sustainability" differently and have conflicting priorities. The commitment becomes a deck of slides rather than operational reality.

**Multi-site operational inconsistency.** Companies that have grown through acquisition or geographic expansion often find that each facility runs differently. One plant has world-class quality processes; another struggles with basic consistency. One distribution center achieves 97% on-time shipping; another is at 78%. The operations team knows this is a problem, but attempts to "standardize" get bogged down in local resistance and "but our situation is different" explanations.

**Digital transformation investments that don't deliver ROI.** Companies invest in demand forecasting, production planning, quality management, and supply chain visibility systems. Six months later, usage is spotty and teams are still using spreadsheets and emails because "the new system doesn't work for us." The technology wasn't the problem—the lack of change management and process redesign was.

**Cross-functional coordination failures.** Sales wants flexibility to respond to customer needs. Operations wants long production runs and stable forecasts. Supply chain wants inventory buffers. Finance wants working capital reduction. These aren't bad people with bad intentions—they're people with competing objectives and no structured way to make trade-offs that optimize for company goals rather than departmental goals.

## Where Executives Get Stuck

These are the frustrations household goods leaders share in initial conversations:

"We've acquired three regional brands in the past four years to build national scale. Each acquisition made strategic sense. But we're still running like three separate companies. We have three different ERP systems, three different approaches to customer service, and very little knowledge sharing. The synergies we projected aren't materializing."

"Everyone agrees we need to shift toward more sustainable products—the market is demanding it, regulations are coming, and it's the right thing to do. But when we try to reformulate products or change packaging, we get stuck in endless debates between R&D, Procurement, and Marketing. Each group has valid concerns, but no one can make a decision."

"Our operations are solid when things go according to plan, but we have zero flexibility. When a customer needs a rush order or we have a raw material shortage or equipment breaks down, everything falls apart. We firefight constantly instead of building resilience into how we operate."

"We know collaboration is important. We've run workshops on 'breaking down silos' and talked about the importance of cross-functional teamwork. People nod in the meetings, but then go back to their departments and nothing changes. The org chart says we're one company, but we act like a collection of independent functions."

These aren't strategy problems or market problems. They're organizational capability problems—exactly what Rooted was designed to solve.

## How Rooted Helps Household Goods Leaders

### Organizational Network Analysis (ONA): Making the Invisible Visible

A household cleaning products manufacturer with $180M in revenue and operations across four facilities was struggling with quality inconsistency. The quality team blamed different equipment. Operations blamed inconsistent training. The executive team didn't know who was right.

We used ONA to map how quality knowledge and problem-solving actually happened across sites. The data revealed something surprising: two facilities consistently outperformed the others not because they had better equipment, but because they had strong informal knowledge-sharing networks. Experienced operators mentored newer ones. Quality techs collaborated to solve problems. The other two facilities had organizational structures that looked identical on paper but lacked these informal connections—people worked in isolation, repeated mistakes, and reinvented solutions.

We didn't change the org chart. We identified high-performers who were natural connectors, gave them formal roles as quality coaches across facilities, established structured peer learning sessions, and created communication channels so problems solved at one site quickly spread to others. Quality variance across facilities dropped by 47% in six months. They didn't train more or spend more on equipment—they just enabled the organization to learn from itself.

### Organizational Change Management (OCM): Turning Integration Chaos Into Capability Building

A household goods company acquired a competitor to gain distribution access and product line extensions. The operations integration plan was detailed: consolidate warehousing, merge ERP systems, standardize processes. What they didn't plan for was organizational resistance.

The acquired company's employees felt like they were being taken over rather than joined. The parent company's team was frustrated that "they won't adopt our better processes." Communication was formal and top-down. Trust was low. Six months in, voluntary turnover in the acquired company hit 35% and operational KPIs were declining.

We designed a change program that acknowledged the emotional reality of the acquisition. We facilitated sessions where employees from both companies could voice concerns and co-create solutions instead of having solutions imposed. We established cross-company integration teams to tackle specific challenges—warehouse consolidation, system migration, process harmonization—with representatives from both organizations having real input and decision rights.

We coached leaders on integration-specific change leadership: acknowledging loss and transition, building trust through transparency, celebrating quick wins, and demonstrating that good ideas from the acquired company would be adopted, not dismissed. Turnover stabilized at normal levels, system adoption hit targets, and the integration went from disaster track to model.

### Business Process Engineering (BPE): Designing Operations That Drive Performance

A cleaning products manufacturer was losing shelf space to private label brands because of inconsistent on-time delivery—sometimes 95%, sometimes 78%, unpredictable. The operations team was working hard but seemed to be constantly reacting to crises. The VP of Operations wanted to "fix our processes."

We started by understanding how work actually flowed, not how the process manual said it should flow. Through observation and interviews with planners, production schedulers, warehouse managers, and customer service reps, we discovered the real problem: each function had optimized their own processes without considering how decisions in one area created chaos downstream.

Planning created forecasts that made sense for inventory management but were useless for production scheduling. Production optimized for efficiency (long runs, minimal changeovers) without considering customer delivery requirements. Warehousing made receiving and putaway decisions based on space optimization, making picking for customer orders slow and error-prone.

We redesigned the order-to-delivery process holistically, starting with customer requirements and working backward. We established decision-making frameworks that balanced trade-offs across functions based on customer impact and company profitability, not departmental preferences. We created feedback loops so problems got surfaced and solved rather than passed downstream.

On-time delivery stabilized above 93%, order lead times dropped from five days to three days, and the operations team stopped firefighting and started improving. They won back lost accounts and gained new ones based on reliability.

### Organizational Development & Effectiveness (OD&E): Building Leadership That Can Scale

A household products company had grown from $50M to $180M in six years through organic growth and acquisitions. The leadership team—mostly promoted from within—were excellent functional experts but had never managed at this scale before. The CEO was a bottleneck on every major decision. Strategic initiatives stalled because leaders couldn't navigate the complexity and politics of a larger organization.

We designed a leadership development program built around real business challenges. We didn't send leaders to generic workshops—we coached them as they worked on actual problems like standardizing operations across four facilities, implementing new product development processes, and improving forecast accuracy.

We taught them frameworks for strategic thinking, stakeholder management, decision-making under uncertainty, and leading cross-functional initiatives. More importantly, we helped them develop the confidence and credibility to challenge each other constructively, make decisions without perfect information, and hold each other accountable.

The CEO told us the program's real value became clear six months later when the leadership team handled a major supply disruption without escalating to her—they assessed the situation, made trade-offs, communicated with customers proactively, and solved it. That's when she knew they'd developed the capability to scale the business.

## Why Mid-Market Leaders Work With Rooted

Large consulting firms will benchmark you against competitors and deliver standardized recommendations. Rooted is different. We help you build an organization that works the way your business actually needs to work—not according to someone else's best practices.

We understand household goods companies. We know the margin pressure, the retailer power dynamics, the private label competition, the complexity of reformulation and regulatory compliance. We've worked with companies at your stage facing your specific challenges.

Mid-market household goods companies choose Rooted because:
- We focus on building internal capability, not consultant dependency
- We deliver measurable results in quarters, not years
- We adapt our approach to your culture and constraints, not the other way around
- We've been operators ourselves—we know what it takes to implement change, not just recommend it

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value

**Scenario 1: Making Sustainability Operational, Not Just Aspirational**

A $150M household cleaning products company committed to transitioning 75% of products to plant-based formulations within three years to meet retailer sustainability requirements and consumer demand. The head of sustainability had a plan. R&D said the timeline was impossible. Procurement warned that natural ingredients cost more and had supply reliability issues. Marketing worried about performance perception. Operations highlighted production complexity.

Two years in, they'd converted 12% of products and were way behind schedule. The sustainability team blamed lack of commitment. Other functions blamed unrealistic timelines and inadequate resources.

We facilitated intensive working sessions where each function laid out their real constraints—technical, financial, operational—without sugarcoating. We created cross-functional tiger teams with dedicated time to solve specific reformulation challenges for high-volume products. We established clear decision rights about trade-offs between sustainability, cost, and performance.

Critically, we helped the executive team understand that sustainability transformation isn't a sustainability department project—it requires fundamental changes in how R&D, Procurement, Manufacturing, and Sales work. We coached leaders on making tough resource allocation decisions and removing organizational barriers to progress.

They hit 65% conversion in 30 months, ahead of the revised target. More importantly, they built organizational capability to handle complex, cross-functional transformation challenges that will serve them well beyond this specific initiative.

**Scenario 2: Post-Acquisition Integration That Captures Synergies**

A household products manufacturer acquired a regional competitor with complementary product lines and distribution. The deal thesis was sound: eliminate duplicate overhead, consolidate manufacturing into more efficient facilities, cross-sell products through combined distribution networks. Projected cost synergies: $8M annually.

Eighteen months post-close, they'd achieved $1.2M in synergies. Customer service scores had declined. Voluntary turnover in the acquired company was 40%. Integration costs were running 60% over budget. The CEO was frustrated—the strategic rationale was solid, but execution was failing.

We conducted a diagnostic using ONA to understand how the two organizations were (or weren't) working together. The findings were stark: almost no organic collaboration across legacy organizations, duplication of work, conflicting priorities, and mutual suspicion about whose way of doing things was "better."

We didn't restart the integration from scratch—too much time and money were already invested. Instead, we identified the critical areas where integration was stalling (warehouse consolidation, customer service integration, supply chain coordination) and formed dedicated integration teams with clear charters, decision rights, and deadlines.

We coached the integration leaders on managing change—acknowledging that integration is hard and people have legitimate concerns about their roles, building trust through transparency, celebrating wins, and addressing poor behavior when people actively sabotaged the integration.

Within eight months, customer service scores recovered, synergies hit $6.2M (running rate), and voluntary turnover normalized. The integration went from cautionary tale to case study.

**Scenario 3: Operational Excellence That Drives Growth**

A household products company was stuck. Revenue had plateaued around $120M for two years. The market was growing, they had good products, but they couldn't scale operations to support growth. Every attempt to increase volume created chaos—missed deliveries, quality problems, customer complaints. The operations team was exhausted from constant firefighting.

We used BPE to redesign their core operations processes—not by creating elegant process maps, but by working with frontline supervisors, production planners, and warehouse leads to understand what was actually breaking when volume increased.

The problem wasn't capacity—they had it. The problem was that every process was designed with workarounds and tribal knowledge that fell apart under stress. Production scheduling depended on one planner who "knew how things worked." Warehouse efficiency relied on three senior workers who knew where everything was. Quality checks happened at the end of production, catching problems too late.

We redesigned processes to eliminate dependency on tribal knowledge, moved quality checks upstream so problems were caught early, created production scheduling tools that any planner could use effectively, and established clear escalation paths for exceptions.

We also worked with the operations leadership team to shift from a firefighting mindset to a continuous improvement mindset—establishing regular process review meetings, creating space for proactive problem-solving, and developing the team's capability to optimize operations over time.

Revenue grew to $160M over the next 18 months with the same operations footprint and headcount. Customer delivery performance went from 81% to 96%. The operations team went from exhausted to energized because they were running the business instead of the business running them.

## The Logistics Sector's Organizational Problem

The logistics and transportation industry is experiencing robust growth while simultaneously confronting operational complexity that would make anyone's head spin. Global transportation and logistics output is expected to grow 4.1% in 2025.[1] The global logistics industry is projected to reach $14.08 trillion by 2028.[2] Trucking is expected to increase 1.6% throughout 2025.[3] The global AI in logistics market exploded to $20.8 billion in 2025, representing a 45.6% compound annual growth rate since 2020.[4]

Here's what those growth numbers hide: the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports nearly 450,000 job openings in transportation and warehousing—one of the highest vacancy rates across industries—while the American Trucking Associations estimates a driver shortage of roughly 60,000 that could grow to 160,000 by 2030.[5][6] Warehouse automation markets are expanding rapidly, but most logistics operations still process email, PDFs and spreadsheets manually to keep freight moving.[4] Customer expectations have reached impossible heights—41% of consumers now expect delivery in under 24 hours—while margins stay razor thin and operational complexity multiplies.[7]

The strategies are clear: implement automation, adopt AI-powered optimization, build resilient supply chains, expand capacity, improve service levels. Everyone knows what needs to happen. The problem is execution. Your organization can't keep pace with technological change. Your workforce is unstable. Your processes weren't designed for current operational complexity. Your cross-functional coordination breaks down under pressure.

The Big 5 will sell you a supply chain transformation program with beautiful process maps and implementation timelines that assume you can pause operations for organizational change. They'll bring consultants who've studied logistics but never managed a warehouse at 2 a.m. when a client's urgent shipment is stuck and your best dispatcher just quit.

We work differently. We help logistics and transportation companies build organizations that can execute in high-pressure operational environments where client commitments are non-negotiable, margins are tight, and workforce instability is constant.

## Why Logistics Companies Have Organizational Problems

The logistics industry operates in permanent crisis mode. Every day brings new operational challenges—capacity constraints, client escalations, technology failures, staffing shortages, regulatory changes, supply chain disruptions. You're expected to absorb these challenges and maintain service levels anyway.

The labor shortage isn't improving. Driver turnover at large truckload carriers runs above 90% annually, while frontline warehouse turnover often exceeds 50%.[6][8] Technology adoption that should streamline operations often creates new problems—systems that don't talk to each other, automation that breaks existing workflows, platforms employees won't use. Supply chain disruptions that used to be occasional are now constant, requiring organizational agility most logistics companies haven't built.[9][10]

Your org chart shows clear reporting lines and functional responsibilities. Reality is messier. The dispatcher who knows which carriers to call for urgent freight. The warehouse supervisor clients actually trust. The operations manager who coordinates complex moves that shouldn't be possible. When these people leave, organizational capability walks out with them.

Transformation programs designed for stable industries don't work in logistics. You can't pause client operations for six months to implement new processes. You can't pull warehouse workers off shifts for training programs. You can't wait for perfect data before making decisions. You need organizational solutions that work within operational reality—not despite it.

## How Rooted Helps Logistics & Transportation Companies

We come with approaches that work in mid-market logistics environments where client service pressures are constant, margins are tight, and you can't pause operations for organizational change.

### Organizational Network Analysis: Map Critical Service Networks

Logistics operations depend on informal networks that org charts don't capture. The dispatcher who knows which carriers to call for urgent shipments. The warehouse supervisor clients trust. The operations manager who coordinates complex multimodal logistics. When these people leave, organizational capability walks out with them.

Rooted uses Organizational Network Analysis to identify critical knowledge holders whose departure would disrupt client service, map communication patterns between account management, operations and warehouse teams to reveal coordination gaps, understand informal workflows that make client commitments achievable, and spot organizational bottlenecks that slow everything down.[11][12]

This visibility protects institutional knowledge, enables strategic succession planning, and improves cross-functional coordination. We've helped logistics companies identify that their most critical operational knowledge resided in three people who weren't on anyone's succession plan, that client escalations got resolved through informal networks that formal processes bypassed entirely, and that warehouse and transportation teams had no natural communication channels despite needing to coordinate constantly.

### Organizational Change Management: Drive Technology and Process Adoption

Logistics companies constantly implement change—WMS upgrades, TMS platforms, automation, carrier integration systems, new client onboarding processes. But change only works when people adopt it. Rooted designs change programs that work in logistics environments.

Our OCM approach includes leadership alignment on implementation strategy, employee engagement to address adoption barriers, client communication about new capabilities, phased rollouts that prevent service disruption, and post-launch support that ensures changes stick. We don't create change management theater—we create adoption.

We've helped logistics companies implement platform migrations where adoption reached 90% within 90 days, redesign client onboarding processes that reduced implementation time by 40%, and manage automation implementations where workforce transitions happened without service disruptions or mass departures.

### Business Process Engineering: Optimize Service Workflows

Logistics companies often run on processes designed for lower operational complexity. Manual workflows that should be automated. Client onboarding processes that weren't designed for current service requirements. Warehouse receiving procedures that create bottlenecks. Carrier coordination that depends on individual heroics instead of systematic processes.

Rooted's BPE approach redesigns processes for logistics realities.[13][14] We map current workflows end-to-end, identify bottlenecks that org charts miss, design new processes that account for how work actually gets done, and implement changes that improve efficiency without breaking client service.

We've helped logistics companies redesign client onboarding processes that reduced implementation time from 90 days to 45 days, optimize warehouse receiving and fulfillment workflows that improved accuracy by 18% and throughput by 22%, and streamline carrier coordination processes that reduced transportation costs by 15% while improving on-time performance.

### Organizational Development & Effectiveness: Build Workforce Resilience

Logistics operations require workforce capability that most companies haven't systematically built. You can't pull warehouse workers off shifts for training. You can't wait for external hires to fill every capability gap. You need to build capability, reduce turnover, and create workforce stability in high-pressure operational environments.

Our OD&E work helps logistics companies analyze turnover root causes, design retention strategies that work in logistics environments, create career pathways from frontline roles to management, build leadership capability at the supervisor level, and develop workforce planning models that account for seasonality and growth projections.

We've helped logistics companies reduce warehouse turnover from 55% to 35% within nine months, develop internal talent pipelines that filled 60% of supervisor roles from within instead of external hiring, and create workforce stability that enabled consistent service quality across shifts and locations.

## Rooted's Approach by Transportation Mode

Logistics and transportation isn't one industry—it's six different operating environments with distinct economics, regulations, and risk profiles. Here's how Rooted's services translate into mode-specific value.

### Trucking & Road Freight

Trucking operations live and die by dispatch efficiency and driver availability. When tariffs trigger volume spikes or driver shortages hit, the informal networks that actually route loads and manage exceptions become critical—and invisible.

Rooted uses Organizational Network Analysis to map how dispatch, customer service, pricing, and maintenance teams coordinate during disruptions.[15] We reveal the hidden bottlenecks in load assignment and exception handling that slow response when markets shift. Then we reengineer order-to-cash and load planning workflows, using automation for repetitive tasks like rating, tendering, and proof-of-delivery entry to cut cycle times without requiring complete system replacement.[16][17]

For carriers shifting toward digitally enabled or asset-light models, we support the transition with new decision rights, KPIs, and adoption programs that help planners and drivers adapt as automation and telematics reshape their roles.[15]

**Recent example:** A regional LTL carrier used ONA to identify three dispatchers who handled 70% of complex rerouting decisions. When one retired, on-time performance dropped 12 points. We documented their decision frameworks, redesigned exception workflows, and cut resolution time by 40%.

### Ocean & Port-Based Logistics

Ocean logistics is a coordination nightmare—trade compliance, ocean procurement, terminals, and inland teams all need to sync documentation and bookings to hit schedule reliability targets. Delays in any handoff cascade into port dwell and demurrage costs.

We analyze collaboration networks between these groups to pinpoint where documentation or booking delays undermine free-time performance.[18] Then we standardize and partially automate booking, VGM filing, and customs workflows using RPA and digital document flows to reduce dwell times while improving visibility for shippers.[19][17]

For companies building port community systems or participating in green corridor initiatives, we design governance and operating models that align carriers, terminals, and 3PLs around shared resilience and sustainability objectives.[20][15]

**Recent example:** An NVOCC reduced average dwell time by 2.1 days by automating customs documentation workflows and redesigning handoffs between ocean and inland teams.

### Air Cargo & Express

Air cargo operates on tight margins with extreme time pressure. The people who actually coordinate capacity swaps, priority uplift, and cold-chain exceptions across airlines, ground handlers, and forwarders are rarely the ones on the org chart.

Rooted identifies these informal "control tower" roles and strengthens their networks for disruption response.[15] We redesign airway bill, booking, and status-update processes to eliminate manual data entry—a frequent error and cost driver in air and cold-chain operations.[21][19]

For carriers shifting toward time-definite, premium products with integrated digital tracking, we align sales, operations, and IT on product architectures, service promises, and escalation paths so the organization can actually deliver what's being sold.[15]

**Recent example:** A freight forwarder reduced cold-chain exceptions by 35% after we mapped informal coordination networks and formalized exception protocols across three airlines and two ground handlers.

### Rail & Intermodal

Rail planning, intermodal terminals, drayage partners, and shipper customers form complex interdependencies that break down during reroutes, embargoes, or weather events. The org chart doesn't show who actually makes decisions when corridors get constrained.

We map these interdependencies to pinpoint where information breaks down during disruptions.[22][20] Then we engineer standardized disruption playbooks and cross-modal rebooking processes that allow operations to route flows dynamically between rail, road, and barge when needed.[20][18]

For rail operators moving toward synchromodal thinking, we develop organizational structures and incentive systems that reward choosing the optimal mode mix for resilience, cost, and emissions—rather than defending modal silos.[20][15]

**Recent example:** A Class II railroad reduced delay-related penalties by 28% after we built disruption playbooks that enabled systematic rerouting across rail and dray without executive escalation.

### Parcel, Last-Mile & E-Commerce

Last-mile operations require coordination between network planning, e-commerce customers, local delivery partners, and customer support. Real-time changes need to propagate through the entire ecosystem—but often don't.

We visualize these networks to understand how changes actually flow through the last-mile system and where they get stuck.[23] Then we streamline fulfillment-to-door workflows, applying automation to label creation, manifesting, exceptions, and claims—tasks research shows are highly automatable but rarely prioritized.[24][21]

For companies shifting toward hyperlocal, green, or crowd-sourced models, we redesign roles, metrics, and partner management practices as digitalization and sustainability become competitive differentiators.[25][23]

**Recent example:** A regional parcel carrier reduced delivery exceptions by 22% after we automated manifesting workflows and redesigned partner communication protocols.

### Cross-Modal Control Towers & Multimodal Networks

Moving freight across multiple modes requires someone to orchestrate end-to-end—but org charts rarely show who that actually is. Single points of failure in crisis communication and decision-making create vulnerability.

We use network analysis to identify who orchestrates multimodal moves and where coordination breaks down across modes.[22][18] Then we build unified, mode-agnostic process architectures and data standards that allow control towers to optimize flows across trucking, rail, ocean, and air.[24][15]

Most importantly, we institutionalize a multimodal operating model—governance, incentives, escalation paths—that embeds resilience, digital tools, and sustainability criteria into day-to-day planning rather than treating them as side projects.[15][20]

**Recent example:** A 3PL managing automotive supply chains reduced modal switching time from 4.5 days to 18 hours after we redesigned their control tower operating model and built cross-modal coordination protocols.

## When Logistics Leaders Call Us

Economic volatility, policy uncertainty, and operational complexity are creating situations where traditional operating models break down. These are the five scenarios where logistics and transportation executives tell us Rooted delivers immediate value.

### 1. Tariff Announcements Are Causing Demand Whiplash

Tariff uncertainty creates early inventory pulls, non-standard peak seasons, and rapid swings between excess and constrained capacity.[26][27] Your network and org structure were designed for predictable cycles—not this.

**What's actually happening:** Commercial, pricing, network planning, and operations teams can't coordinate fast enough during tariff announcements and "front-loading" events.[11] Lane changes, contract repricing, and capacity shifts that should take days are taking weeks. By the time you respond, market conditions have shifted again.

**How Rooted helps:** We use Organizational Network Analysis to map how your teams actually coordinate during tariff events and identify the hidden decision bottlenecks delaying your response.[11][12] Then we redesign forecasting-to-execution workflows so rate, routing, and capacity decisions can be re-optimized within days when tariffs change—including standard playbooks for pre-tariff surges and post-tariff hangovers.[13][14]

For companies tired of treating every tariff event as a one-off fire drill, we institutionalize a cross-functional "policy response cell" with clear decision rights that treats tariff scenarios as repeatable, manageable events.[28]

**Recent context:** March 2024 Logistics Managers' Index data showed tariff concerns cooling logistics growth as supply chain leaders struggled to forecast demand amid policy uncertainty.[26] Companies with systematic response capabilities maintained service levels while competitors scrambled.

### 2. You Need Automation But Can't Justify the CapEx Right Now

Interest-rate uncertainty and cost inflation are forcing logistics firms to defer large automation, fleet, and real-estate investments—even as operating complexity continues rising.[29][30] Capital is constrained while costs are forecast to expand rapidly.

**What's actually happening:** Your operations need automation, but your CFO won't approve major capex until rates stabilize. Meanwhile, manual processes are costing you margin and creating service inconsistency. You're stuck between "can't afford to invest" and "can't afford not to."

**How Rooted helps:** We identify underutilized network experts and informal coordinators who can accelerate ROI from smaller, modular automation and RPA deployments that don't require mega-capex approval.[31][11] We target no-regrets process reengineering—order-to-cash, dock scheduling, claims, exception management—that delivers cost and service gains with minimal capital investment.[14][13]

Then we build a staged automation roadmap that sequences RPA in shipment scheduling and documentation first, saving higher-capex physical automation for when rate paths and cash generation support it.[32][31]

**Recent context:** July 2024 LMI data showed logistics costs expanding rapidly while many firms deferred capital investments.[29] Companies that focused on process improvements and modular automation maintained competitiveness without betting the balance sheet.

### 3. Green Incentives Are Creating Winners and Losers in Your Network

Governments are expanding incentives for low-emission vehicles and infrastructure while tightening emissions and zoning rules.[33] Some of your depots, geographies, or customer segments are suddenly becoming unviable under new regulations.[34]

**What's actually happening:** You know you need to decarbonize, but you don't know which sites should get low-emission assets first, which legacy facilities to exit, or how to manage workforce transitions without losing institutional knowledge. Equipment decisions that used to be straightforward now involve range constraints, charging windows, and dramatically different cost structures.

**How Rooted helps:** We reveal which site leaders and fleet managers are central to adoption of new equipment and eco-routing practices—and where resistance or information gaps cluster.[35][11] Then we redesign transport planning, asset scheduling, and maintenance processes to integrate range constraints and charging windows rather than overlaying them on diesel-era workflows.[36][13]

For companies making network redesign decisions, we support the facility rationalization strategy and manage workforce communications, skills transitions, and culture shifts toward green operations at scale.[34][28]

**Recent context:** 2024-2025 government incentives for green logistics are accelerating unevenly across regions and segments.[33] Companies that systematically redesign around new constraints are capturing competitive advantage while others face stranded assets.

### 4. Your Disruption Response Depends on Heroics, Not Systems

Research on geopolitical disruptions and logistics resilience shows that complex global networks are increasingly vulnerable to policy shocks, conflicts, and climate events.[37] When disruptions hit, "work-as-done" diverges sharply from "work-as-imagined" on org charts.[15][28]

**What's actually happening:** When rail embargoes hit or ports get congested, a few key people scramble to coordinate reroutes, modal shifts, and customer communication. They make it work—but it's exhausting, inconsistent, and fragile. If those people leave, organizational capability walks out with them.

**How Rooted helps:** We stress-test your organization's informal networks to identify who actually coordinates during disruptions and where single points of failure or silos threaten resilience.[12][11] Then we codify disruption playbooks into core processes—routing, procurement, customer service—converting ad-hoc heroics into standardized, testable response flows.[13][14]

Finally, we embed resilience into structure and governance (multi-region control towers, clear escalation paths) and reinforce behaviors and incentives that support rapid cross-functional decision-making in crises.[38][28]

**Recent context:** Geopolitical tensions and extreme weather are increasing disruption frequency.[37] Organizations with institutionalized resilience practices recover faster and maintain customer trust through volatility.

### 5. Margin Compression Is Forcing Hard Decisions About Your Portfolio

European and North American logistics firms are feeling the impact of falling freight rates and rising operating costs.[39] Traditional price-plus models no longer clear the cost of capital in some segments, but customer expectations keep rising.

**What's actually happening:** You're competing on price in commoditized lanes while operating costs climb. Some customer segments and service offerings are structurally unprofitable, but you're not sure which ones or how to exit without damaging relationships or morale.

**How Rooted helps:** We distinguish value-creating collaboration patterns (integrated solutions across transport, warehousing, and value-added services) from low-value internal friction so you can focus scarce talent on differentiated offerings.[11][35] Then we reengineer end-to-end solutions for specific verticals—cold chain, e-commerce, industrials—to remove non-value-adding steps and build modular services that can be priced and scaled more profitably.[14][13]

For companies ready to pivot strategy from "volume at any price" to disciplined portfolio management, we help leadership exit structurally unprofitable lanes or segments and align sales, operations, and compensation around target customer profiles and solution sets.[28][38]

**Recent context:** October 2024 Reuters reporting showed European logistics firms facing significant margin pressure from falling freight rates.[39] Companies that systematically analyzed portfolio economics and made disciplined exit decisions protected profitability while volume-focused competitors eroded margins.

These aren't theoretical scenarios—they're the conversations happening in logistics boardrooms right now. Rooted helps you see how your organization actually operates (ONA), redesign the critical value streams (BPE), make the new ways stick (OCM), and align structure and strategy for a volatile policy environment (OSD).

## Why Logistics Leaders Work With Rooted

We're not the Big 5. We don't bring transformation programs that assume you can pause operations. We work with mid-market logistics and transportation companies—3PLs, freight forwarders, warehousing operations, regional carriers, specialty logistics providers.

We work at the mid-market level because that's where organizational strategy creates competitive advantage. Large logistics enterprises can absorb inefficiency through scale. Small providers are nimble enough that everyone knows everything. Mid-market logistics companies have real organizational complexity but need solutions that work within realistic resource constraints and can't disrupt client service.

Our team includes people who've actually managed logistics operations, dealt with client escalations at 2 a.m., managed warehouse teams under pressure, and implemented change while maintaining service commitments. We understand the difference between what works in theory and what works when your largest client is threatening to leave and you're short-staffed.

Our engagements deliver measurable improvements in months, not years. We work with your actual constraints—we're not going to tell you to pause client operations for organizational transformation. And we build your internal capability to continue improving after we leave.

## Let's Talk About What's Possible

If you're leading a logistics or transportation company and dealing with organizational challenges—workforce instability, technology adoption failures, client service inconsistency, scaling problems, or cross-functional coordination breakdowns—Rooted can help.

We're not here to sell you a transformation roadmap that sits on a shelf. We're here to understand your specific challenges and design solutions that work in high-pressure logistics environments where client commitments are non-negotiable.

Let's start a conversation.

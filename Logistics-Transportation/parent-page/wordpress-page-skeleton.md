The Challenge

[HEADLINE - H2]
The Logistics Sector's Organizational Problem

[BODY COPY - 2 columns on desktop, single column mobile]

The logistics and transportation industry is experiencing robust growth while confronting operational complexity that would make anyone's head spin. Global logistics is projected to reach $14.08 trillion by 2028, and the AI in logistics market exploded to $20.8 billion in 2025.

Here's what those growth numbers hide: nearly 450,000 job openings in transportation and warehousing—one of the highest vacancy rates across industries. Driver shortages of 60,000 that could grow to 160,000 by 2030. Warehouse turnover exceeding 50%. Customer expectations have reached impossible heights—41% of consumers expect delivery in under 24 hours—while margins stay razor thin.

**The strategies are clear:** implement automation, adopt AI-powered optimization, build resilient supply chains, improve service levels. Everyone knows what needs to happen.

**The problem is execution.** Your organization can't keep pace with technological change. Your workforce is unstable. Your processes weren't designed for current operational complexity.

The Big 5 will sell you a supply chain transformation program with beautiful process maps that assume you can pause operations for organizational change. They'll bring consultants who've studied logistics but never managed a warehouse at 2 a.m. when a client's urgent shipment is stuck and your best dispatcher just quit.
```

**Design Notes:**
- Use callout/highlight styling for the two bold statements
- Keep paragraphs short and scannable
- Optional: Add subtle stat callouts in margins or as highlight cards

## SECTION 3: WHY ROOTED IS DIFFERENT
**Block Type:** Two-column layout (Greenshift Columns or Core Columns)
**Background:** Brand color (deep blue/navy) - White text
**Padding:** 80px top/bottom (desktop), 60px (mobile)
**Max Width:** 1200px centered

### Left Column (40% width):

We Work Differently

[IMAGE]
[placeholder: rooted-team-logistics.jpg]
```

### Right Column (60% width):
```
[BODY COPY - White text, larger font ~18px]

We help logistics and transportation companies build organizations that can execute in high-pressure operational environments where client commitments are non-negotiable, margins are tight, and workforce instability is constant.

The logistics industry operates in permanent crisis mode. Driver turnover at large truckload carriers runs above 90% annually. Technology adoption that should streamline operations often creates new problems. Supply chain disruptions that used to be occasional are now constant.

**Your org chart shows clear reporting lines. Reality is messier.** The dispatcher who knows which carriers to call. The warehouse supervisor clients actually trust. The operations manager who coordinates complex moves that shouldn't be possible. When these people leave, organizational capability walks out with them.

We come with approaches that work in mid-market logistics environments where client service pressures are constant and you can't pause operations for organizational change.
```

**Design Notes:**
- High contrast (white on dark)
- Image should feel authentic, not stock-photo-y
- Bold the key statement

## SECTION 4: HOW WE HELP - SERVICE OVERVIEW
**Block Type:** Container with 4-column grid (2x2 on mobile)
**Background:** White
**Padding:** 100px top/bottom (desktop), 60px (mobile)
**Max Width:** 1400px centered

### Section Header:
```

Our Services

[HEADLINE - H2, Centered]
How Rooted Helps Logistics & Transportation Companies

[SUBHEADLINE - Centered, max 600px width]
We bring four core organizational capabilities that work in high-pressure logistics environments.
```

### Service Cards (4 cards in responsive grid):

**Card 1: Organizational Network Analysis**
```
[ICON/IMAGE: network-analysis-icon.svg or small image]

[CARD TITLE - H3]
Organizational Network Analysis

[CARD BODY - ~100 words]
Map the critical service networks that org charts don't capture. We identify the dispatcher who knows which carriers to call, the warehouse supervisor clients trust, and the operations manager who makes impossible logistics work.

When these people leave, organizational capability walks out with them. We use ONA to protect institutional knowledge, enable strategic succession planning, and reveal coordination gaps that slow everything down.

```

**Card 2: Business Process Engineering**
```
[ICON/IMAGE: process-engineering-icon.svg or small image]

[CARD TITLE - H3]
Business Process Engineering

[CARD BODY - ~100 words]
Optimize service workflows for logistics realities. We redesign processes designed for lower operational complexity—manual workflows that should be automated, client onboarding that wasn't designed for current service requirements, warehouse procedures that create bottlenecks.

We map workflows end-to-end, identify bottlenecks, and implement changes that improve efficiency without breaking client service.

**Card 3: Organizational Change Management**
```
[ICON/IMAGE: change-management-icon.svg or small image]

[CARD TITLE - H3]
Organizational Change Management

[CARD BODY - ~100 words]
Drive technology and process adoption that actually sticks. Logistics companies constantly implement change—WMS upgrades, TMS platforms, automation, carrier integration systems—but change only works when people adopt it.

We design change programs that work in logistics environments: leadership alignment, employee engagement, phased rollouts that prevent service disruption, and post-launch support that ensures changes stick.

```

**Card 4: Organizational Development & Effectiveness**
```
[ICON/IMAGE: workforce-development-icon.svg or small image]

[CARD TITLE - H3]
Organizational Development & Effectiveness

[CARD BODY - ~100 words]
Build workforce resilience in high-turnover environments. You can't pull warehouse workers off shifts for training. You can't wait for external hires to fill every capability gap.

We help logistics companies analyze turnover root causes, design retention strategies, create career pathways from frontline to management, and build leadership capability at the supervisor level—creating workforce stability that enables consistent service quality.

**Design Notes:**
- Cards should have subtle border or shadow
- Hover effect: slight lift/scale
- Icons should be simple, professional (not cutesy)
- Keep card heights equal using Greenshift or CSS

## SECTION 6: WHEN LEADERS CALL US
**Block Type:** Accordion or Tabbed interface (Greenshift Accordion Block)
**Background:** Light gray (#F9FAFB)
**Padding:** 100px top/bottom (desktop), 60px (mobile)
**Max Width:** 1000px centered

### Section Header:
```
[SECTION LABEL - Small text, brand color]
Common Scenarios

[HEADLINE - H2, Centered]
When Logistics Leaders Call Us

[SUBHEADLINE - Centered, max 700px width]
Economic volatility, policy uncertainty, and operational complexity are creating situations where traditional operating models break down. These are the three scenarios where logistics executives tell us Rooted delivers immediate value.
```

### Scenario Accordions/Tabs:

**Scenario 1: Tariff Announcements Are Causing Demand Whiplash**
```
[ACCORDION HEADER/TAB - H3]
Tariff Announcements Are Causing Demand Whiplash

[ACCORDION CONTENT]

**What's actually happening:**
Commercial, pricing, network planning, and operations teams can't coordinate fast enough during tariff announcements and front-loading events. Lane changes, contract repricing, and capacity shifts that should take days are taking weeks. By the time you respond, market conditions have shifted again.

**How Rooted helps:**
We use Organizational Network Analysis to map how your teams coordinate during tariff events and identify hidden decision bottlenecks. Then we redesign forecasting-to-execution workflows so rate, routing, and capacity decisions can be re-optimized within days when tariffs change.

For companies tired of treating every tariff event as a one-off fire drill, we institutionalize a "policy response cell" with clear decision rights that treats tariff scenarios as repeatable, manageable events.

[OPTIONAL: Small case example or stat callout]
```

**Scenario 2: You Need Automation But Can't Justify the CapEx**
```
[ACCORDION HEADER/TAB - H3]
You Need Automation But Can't Justify the CapEx Right Now

[ACCORDION CONTENT]

**What's actually happening:**
Your operations need automation, but your CFO won't approve major capex until rates stabilize. Meanwhile, manual processes are costing you margin and creating service inconsistency. You're stuck between "can't afford to invest" and "can't afford not to."

**How Rooted helps:**
We identify underutilized network experts and informal coordinators who can accelerate ROI from smaller, modular automation and RPA deployments that don't require mega-capex approval. We target no-regrets process reengineering—order-to-cash, dock scheduling, claims, exception management—that delivers cost and service gains with minimal capital investment.

Then we build a staged automation roadmap that sequences RPA in shipment scheduling and documentation first, saving higher-capex physical automation for when cash generation supports it.
```

**Scenario 3: Your Disruption Response Depends on Heroics, Not Systems**
```
[ACCORDION HEADER/TAB - H3]
Your Disruption Response Depends on Heroics, Not Systems

[ACCORDION CONTENT]

**What's actually happening:**
When rail embargoes hit or ports get congested, a few key people scramble to coordinate reroutes, modal shifts, and customer communication. They make it work—but it's exhausting, inconsistent, and fragile. If those people leave, organizational capability walks out with them.

**How Rooted helps:**
We stress-test your organization's informal networks to identify who actually coordinates during disruptions and where single points of failure threaten resilience. Then we codify disruption playbooks into core processes—routing, procurement, customer service—converting ad-hoc heroics into standardized, testable response flows.

Finally, we embed resilience into structure and governance (multi-region control towers, clear escalation paths) and reinforce behaviors that support rapid cross-functional decision-making in crises.
```

**Design Notes:**
- First accordion open by default
- Smooth expand/collapse animation
- Consider using icons next to each scenario header
- Bold the "What's happening" and "How Rooted helps" labels

Why Logistics Leaders Work With Rooted

[BODY COPY - ~250 words]

We're not the Big 5. We don't bring transformation programs that assume you can pause operations. We work with mid-market logistics and transportation companies—3PLs, freight forwarders, warehousing operations, regional carriers, specialty logistics providers.

**We work at the mid-market level because that's where organizational strategy creates competitive advantage.** Large logistics enterprises can absorb inefficiency through scale. Small providers are nimble enough that everyone knows everything. Mid-market logistics companies have real organizational complexity but need solutions that work within realistic resource constraints and can't disrupt client service.

Our team includes people who've actually managed logistics operations, dealt with client escalations at 2 a.m., managed warehouse teams under pressure, and implemented change while maintaining service commitments. We understand the difference between what works in theory and what works when your largest client is threatening to leave and you're short-staffed.

**Our engagements deliver measurable improvements in months, not years.** We work with your actual constraints—we're not going to tell you to pause client operations for organizational transformation. And we build your internal capability to continue improving after we leave.
```

### Right Column (50%):
```
[IMAGE]
[placeholder: rooted-logistics-consultation.jpg]

[OPTIONAL: Pullquote or Key Differentiator List]
✓ Mid-market focused
✓ Real logistics operations experience
✓ Results in months, not years
✓ No transformation theater
✓ Build your internal capability
```

**Design Notes:**
- Keep this section credible and grounded
- No hype, no fluff
- Bold the key statements
- Image should feel authentic

**Navigating Margin Pressure and Market Uncertainty**

Asset-based carriers face the tightest financial conditions in years. The freight recession that began in late 2022 has persisted longer than most forecasts predicted, and the recovery entering late 2025 remains fragile. The truckload sector reported an average operating margin of -2.3% in 2024, with most segments struggling to maintain margins above 2%.¹ Non-fuel operating costs hit record highs at $1.78 per mile, while contract rates remained depressed.² For executives leading regional and mid-market carriers, this isn't a problem you can simply wait out. Companies that don't actively address operational inefficiency, driver retention, and technology adoption will fall further behind.

## The Challenge

**Workforce crisis, technology adoption, operational waste, and margin pressure**

**Driver recruitment and retention crisis.** Industry estimates place the gap between 60,000 and 80,000 drivers in 2025, with projections climbing to over 170,000 by 2030.³ The average driver age has reached 48, and retirements are accelerating faster than new entrants join the industry.⁴ Recruiting is expensive when you're competing against larger carriers offering sign-on bonuses you can't afford. When drivers leave after six months, you've invested in recruiting, training, and onboarding with nothing to show for it.

**Technology implementation failures.** You invested in a TMS that was supposed to streamline dispatch, improve load planning, and provide real-time visibility. Eight months later, half your dispatchers are still using spreadsheets and phone calls because the system is "too complicated" or "takes longer than the old way." ELD compliance is mandatory, but integration with back-office systems remains clunky. Real-time tracking exists, but customer-facing visibility tools sit unused because nobody implemented them properly.

**Operational inefficiency and process gaps.** Empty miles averaged 16.7% across the industry in 2024—meaning nearly one in six miles driven generates zero revenue.¹ Load planning is inconsistent. Some planners are excellent at sequencing loads and minimizing deadhead; others leave money on the table every day. Billing and settlements are manual. Invoice errors create disputes with brokers and shippers that delay payment. Maintenance schedules are reactive rather than predictive, leading to unexpected breakdowns and downtime.

**Margin pressure and cost management.** Insurance premiums jumped 3% in 2024 after a 12.5% spike the prior year, hitting a record high of $0.102 per mile.¹ Truck and trailer lease payments rose 8.3%, reaching $0.39 per mile.⁵ Driver wage pressures persist—you need to pay competitively to attract and retain talent, but raising wages squeezes already thin margins. Equipment costs are high due to tariffs on imported parts and trucks. The operating ratio that used to sit at 93% now hovers at 96% or worse.

## Where Leaders Get Stuck

You don't know why some planners perform better than others. Your top load planner consistently hits 12% empty miles while others average 18%. One dispatcher keeps drivers happy and retention is strong; another has constant turnover. You suspect it's about relationships, communication style, or problem-solving ability—but you can't see the informal networks and knowledge flows that make the difference. When your best performers leave or retire, their expertise walks out the door.

Technology rollouts fail because adoption is low. You bought the TMS. You paid for training. You sent the announcement emails. Six months later, usage is at 40%, and people are working around the system rather than with it. The vendor says the platform is working fine. Your IT team says training was provided. But if dispatchers, drivers, and back-office staff aren't using the tools, your investment isn't delivering ROI.

Dispatch and driver communication breaks down. Drivers say dispatch doesn't communicate load changes clearly. Dispatchers say drivers don't respond promptly or follow instructions. Loads get missed. Appointments are late. Customers complain. The org chart shows clear reporting lines, but in practice, communication is fragmented. Some drivers text their favorite dispatcher directly. Others call the office and talk to whoever answers.

Back-office inefficiency creates cash flow problems. Your accounting team is buried in invoices, driver settlements, and payment reconciliation. Brokers dispute charges because documentation is missing or incorrect. Payment cycles stretch to 45 or 60 days. Driver pay is delayed because settlement calculations are manual and time-consuming. The root problem isn't financing—it's inefficient billing and settlement processes that create delays in the first place.

## How Rooted Helps

We don't show up with PowerPoints about digital transformation. Our approaches work in transportation environments where you need to retain drivers, adopt technology effectively, eliminate operational waste, and protect margins simultaneously.

### Organizational Network Analysis: Understand How Work Really Gets Done

**Transportation operations depend on informal networks more than org charts suggest. Dispatchers have favorite drivers. Planners rely on specific brokers. Maintenance managers coordinate with certain drivers who flag issues early. Before workforce changes, we identify critical knowledge holders—which dispatchers are go-to problem-solvers, which drivers mentor newer team members, and which mechanics handle the most complex repairs. You can make reduction decisions strategically rather than cutting based on seniority alone and accidentally losing the people who keep everything running.**

**When technology adoption is low, we find the influencers. You rolled out a new TMS, but veteran dispatchers aren't using it. ONA identifies the informal influencers in your dispatch team—the people others turn to for advice and guidance. If these key individuals don't adopt the system, nobody else will either. By engaging these influencers early, addressing their concerns, and turning them into advocates, you transform resistance into momentum.**

**Key Points:**
- Identify critical dispatchers and problem-solvers
- Map driver-dispatcher relationship networks
- Reveal informal mentorship and training patterns
- Locate technology adoption influencers

### Change Management: Drive Technology and Process Adoption

**Transportation management systems, route optimization software, and electronic logging devices promise efficiency gains, but success depends on adoption. We design change programs that include leadership alignment on implementation strategy, employee engagement to address adoption barriers, phased rollouts that don't disrupt operations, and training that matches how dispatchers and drivers actually work. When change is managed well, technology delivers the ROI you expected.**

**When you're acquiring another carrier or opening a new terminal, integration looks straightforward on paper. In reality, the acquired company has its own informal leaders, communication patterns, and ways of doing things. We help you see both networks before merging operations, identify bridge-builders who connect cultures, spot potential resistance points, and design integration plans based on how people actually collaborate—not just how the new structure says they should.**

**Key Points:**
- TMS and technology adoption strategies
- Driver and dispatcher engagement plans
- M&A integration and culture alignment
- Training programs matched to workflows

### Business Process Engineering: Design Processes That Actually Work

**Your best planners hit 10-12% empty miles; others average 18-20%. The difference costs tens of thousands of dollars per month. We shadow your planners, map their decision-making process, and identify what top performers do differently—how they sequence loads, which lanes they prioritize, how they balance driver home time with load optimization. We then design a standardized planning process that captures best practices, create decision-support tools, and provide training.**

**Manual invoicing and driver settlement processes create delays, errors, and cash flow problems. We map your billing workflow from load completion through invoice submission, dispute resolution, and payment collection. We identify where data entry happens multiple times, where documentation gets lost, and where errors originate. We redesign the process: automate invoice generation from TMS data, create standard templates for common dispute types, implement digital document management, and build automated settlement calculations.**

**Key Points:**
- Load planning process standardization
- Empty mile reduction methodologies
- Billing and settlement workflow redesign
- Maintenance scheduling optimization

### Organizational Development: Build Workforce Resilience

**Driver retention isn't just about pay. We conduct confidential interviews and surveys to understand what actually drives turnover—home-time promises that aren't kept, communication issues with dispatch, feeling disrespected when raising concerns. We help you design retention strategies that address root causes: realistic home-time policies that can actually be enforced, improved dispatch communication protocols, driver feedback sessions with leadership, and dispatcher training on communication and conflict resolution.**

**Key Points:**
- Driver retention strategy development
- Dispatcher communication training
- Career pathway design for operations roles
- Workforce planning for growth and succession

## Real Examples

**Scenario: Empty miles costing tens of thousands monthly.** A 75-truck carrier averaged 18% empty miles across its planning team, while the top planner consistently hit 11%. We shadowed planners to understand decision patterns, documented best practices, and created standardized load sequencing protocols with decision-support tools. We trained all planners on the new process and implemented performance monitoring. Six months later, fleet-wide empty miles dropped to 13%, saving approximately $42,000 monthly in fuel and reducing driver deadhead hours.

**Scenario: TMS adoption at 35% eight months after implementation.** A regional carrier invested $180K in a new TMS that promised dispatch efficiency and customer visibility. Eight months post-launch, only 35% of dispatchers used the system regularly, and customers weren't accessing the visibility portal. Our assessment revealed the platform worked technically, but workflows hadn't been redesigned, veteran dispatchers found it clunky, and no one engaged them during implementation. We identified informal influencers, addressed usability concerns, redesigned dispatch workflows, and created role-specific training. Four months later, adoption reached 87%, dispatch efficiency improved 15%, and customer portal usage increased 400%.

**Scenario: Driver turnover at 85% crushing margins.** A 60-truck carrier struggled with 85% annual driver turnover—well above industry averages. Recruiting costs exceeded $150K annually, and constant turnover created safety risks and service inconsistencies. Exit interviews provided generic feedback, but leadership didn't know the root cause. We conducted confidential interviews with current drivers and recent departures. The issue wasn't pay—it was broken home-time promises, inconsistent dispatch communication, and drivers feeling disrespected when raising concerns. We redesigned dispatch workflows, created enforceable home-time guidelines, implemented driver feedback sessions, and trained dispatchers on communication. Within 12 months, turnover dropped to 55%, recruiting costs declined by $90K, and safety scores improved.

# Warehousing & Storage

**Growth Amid Labor Pressures and Automation Demands**

The U.S. general warehousing and storage market reached $42.8 billion in 2025, growing at 4.6% annually over the past five years.¹ Global market projections estimate the sector will reach $716 billion by 2033, driven by e-commerce expansion, supply chain optimization, and increased demand for specialized storage like cold chain facilities.² However, this growth comes with challenges. The warehousing industry faces a shortage of over 35,000 workers nationwide, with annual turnover rates exceeding 40% in many facilities—and some locations reporting rates over 150%.³'⁴ Labor costs now account for 55-70% of total warehouse operational budgets.⁴ For executives leading warehouse operations, distribution centers, and cold storage facilities, the operational environment demands managing throughput, implementing automation, addressing safety compliance under intensified OSHA scrutiny, and doing all of this while dealing with workforce instability.

## The Challenge

**Persistent labor shortages and high turnover.** The separation rate was 3.6% in 2024, with hire rates at 4.1%, meaning you're constantly replacing workers just to maintain staffing levels.⁶ This turnover disrupts operations, increases training costs, creates safety risks, and prevents efficiency gains. When experienced workers leave just as they become proficient, quality varies by shift and institutional knowledge walks out regularly.

**Automation implementation without disrupting operations.** By 2025, approximately 4.3 million commercial warehouse robots are expected to be installed worldwide, and automation spending is projected to reach $41 billion by 2027.⁷ But implementing automation while maintaining daily operations is difficult. Which processes get automated first? How do you train employees to work alongside robots? How do you redesign workflows to capture efficiency gains? Many warehouses install technology without achieving expected ROI because they haven't addressed the human and process dimensions of change.

**Safety compliance under intensified scrutiny.** OSHA's National Emphasis Program has increased warehouse inspections, focusing on ergonomic hazards, equipment fit standards, heat illness, and injury reporting.⁸ The fatal injury rate for warehousing exceeds the national average, and OSHA issued nearly $6 million in penalties to major operators in 2023.⁹ Common hazards include forklift operations (approximately 100 deaths annually), loading dock falls (25% of injuries), and ergonomic issues.¹⁰ Compliance requires training, process controls, and documentation—not just posted signs.

**Space utilization and technology integration.** Warehouse rent averages $10.10 per square foot nationally, with cold storage rents up 96% since 2019.¹¹'¹² You need to maximize density, optimize pick paths, and position inventory efficiently while accommodating different storage requirements. Meanwhile, fragmented technology systems prevent operational visibility. Your WMS doesn't integrate cleanly with TMS or order systems, creating manual workarounds, data errors, and fulfillment mistakes.

## Where Leaders Get Stuck

You can't see the informal workflows that actually make operations run. Org charts show supervisors and operators, but not which lead operators train new hires, which shipping clerk coordinates transportation best, or which maintenance tech everyone calls when equipment breaks. When you lose these people or restructure, operational knowledge disappears and nobody knows why efficiency drops.

Automation projects don't deliver expected efficiency. The technology works, but productivity hasn't improved as projected. Employees use manual workarounds, workflows haven't been redesigned, training was insufficient. Technology adoption requires process redesign and change management—not just installation. Six months after implementing a new WMS, employees are back to old habits because change didn't stick.

Safety incidents keep happening despite training. You conduct training and post protocols, but incidents continue. The problem isn't lack of rules—it's that safety protocols don't match workflow pressures. When facing productivity quotas and understaffing, workers take shortcuts. The root causes are process design issues—dock congestion forcing risky maneuvers, loading procedures that are inefficient, handling expectations that are unrealistic.

Workforce instability prevents consistency. High turnover means constant training. Quality varies by shift. You know stability would improve performance, but you're stuck in a cycle where inefficiency causes stress, stress causes turnover, and turnover causes more inefficiency. The issues aren't wage-driven—they're inflexible scheduling, limited career paths, and inconsistent management.

## How Rooted Helps

### Organizational Network Analysis: Uncover How Work Really Flows

Org charts show reporting lines. ONA shows how work actually happens—the lead operator who trains everyone, the scheduler who knows which carriers to call, the maintenance tech who keeps equipment running. We identify critical knowledge holders whose departure would create operational risk, map communication patterns to reveal silos between receiving, storage, picking, and shipping, and understand informal workarounds that bypass formal processes. This visibility lets you protect institutional knowledge before implementing automation or restructuring, identify the informal leaders who need to champion change initiatives, and address root causes rather than symptoms.

### Change Management: Drive Adoption of New Processes and Technology

Change only works when employees adopt it. When implementing automation, new WMS platforms, or safety protocols, employees need to understand why changes are happening and how they're supported. We design change programs including leadership alignment on implementation strategy, employee engagement to address adoption barriers, transparent communication about impact on roles, phased implementation that prevents service disruption, and post-launch support. We help you engage frontline leaders as champions, provide role-specific training that matches actual workflows, and monitor adoption to identify resistance early. Well-managed change means faster ROI, maintained productivity during transitions, and sustained improvements.

### Business Process Engineering: Design Workflows That Actually Work

Efficient processes drive warehouse performance. We map current workflows to identify bottlenecks, then redesign processes for efficiency and practicality. We optimize receiving and put-away to improve dock utilization and reduce dwell time. We improve order fulfillment workflows to reduce picker travel, increase accuracy, and accommodate automation. We redesign loading and shipping processes to prevent congestion, reduce dock falls, and improve on-time departures. We streamline inventory management to maintain accuracy while reducing cycle count labor. Our process improvements are designed for real warehouse environments where throughput demands and safety requirements can't be compromised.

### Organizational Development: Build Workforce Resilience

Sustainable warehouse performance requires workforce capability and stability. We help you analyze turnover root causes—compensation, work conditions, management quality, career development—and design retention strategies: competitive pay structures, flexible scheduling options that accommodate workers' lives, clear career pathways from associate to lead to supervisor, recognition programs that acknowledge performance, and frontline leadership development. We help you design organizational structures that support growth without adding overhead, develop workforce planning models that account for seasonality and turnover, and create training programs that reduce time-to-productivity for new hires.

## Real Examples

**Scenario: High turnover disrupting operations.** A regional warehouse operator with 55% annual turnover struggled with constant hiring, training drain, and inconsistent productivity. Our workforce diagnostic revealed turnover wasn't wage-driven—it was inflexible scheduling, limited career paths, and inconsistent management. We designed retention strategies: flexible shifts, skill-based career advancement, supervisor training, recognition programs. Nine months later, turnover dropped to 35%, and operational consistency improved measurably.

**Scenario: WMS implementation not delivering results.** A distribution center's $1.2M WMS investment showed flat picking productivity six months post-launch. Our assessment revealed picking paths didn't match actual storage, screens required too many clicks, and employees weren't involved in design. We redesigned picking workflows, simplified interfaces, conducted targeted training, and implemented feedback loops. Four months later, productivity improved 18% and inventory accuracy reached 99.4%.

**Scenario: Automation requiring workforce transition.** A cold storage facility implementing AS/RS needed to reduce picking roles by 40%. We designed a transition program: transparent communication about timeline and options, role transition pathways into equipment monitoring and maintenance, technical training for new positions, phased implementation that allowed voluntary attrition, and separation support for affected employees. Of 60 affected employees, 42 transitioned successfully to new roles, 15 separated voluntarily with support. AS/RS launched on schedule, morale remained stable, and productivity improved 22%.

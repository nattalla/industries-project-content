## Industry Context: Navigating Credit Quality Amid Technology Disruption
*Managing risk, regulatory compliance, and digital transformation*

The credit and lending sector is experiencing a period of significant change. Consumer debt levels remain elevated—U.S. credit card debt reached $1.17 trillion in 2024 with credit card delinquencies spiking to 11%, the highest since the Great Recession.¹ At the same time, banks have tightened lending standards, with 12.5% of banks reporting stricter standards for commercial and industrial loans to mid-market firms in late 2024, citing economic uncertainty and reduced risk tolerance.² For lending executives—whether leading consumer lending operations, commercial lending divisions, or specialty finance companies—the environment requires balancing growth objectives with prudent risk management.

Technology is reshaping the sector. AI-driven underwriting, alternative data sources, and digital origination platforms are changing how loans are evaluated and processed. However, regulatory scrutiny remains intense. The CFPB's Section 1071 small business lending data rule, with its first compliance deadline approaching, requires lenders to collect and report over 20 data points on small business credit applications, demanding coordination across multiple departments.³ Success in this environment requires operational efficiency, effective change management, and organizational structures that can adapt quickly.

## Common Operational Challenges
*Credit risk management, regulatory compliance, technology modernization, and operational efficiency*

**Credit Quality and Delinquency Management**  
Delinquencies across consumer lending categories—credit cards, auto loans, and student loans—remain concerning. Credit card delinquencies are at their highest level since 2009-2010, and auto loan delinquencies are rising.⁴ For lenders, this means increased loss reserves, higher collection costs, and pressure on profitability. Managing credit quality requires sophisticated risk models, early identification of troubled borrowers, and effective collection processes. But it also requires organizational capacity—skilled underwriters, trained collection specialists, and cross-functional coordination between credit risk, operations, and servicing teams.

**Regulatory Compliance Complexity**  
Lending is one of the most heavily regulated financial services sectors. Fair lending laws (ECOA, HMDA), consumer protection regulations (TILA, RESPA), data privacy requirements, and evolving guidance on AI in underwriting create significant compliance demands. The Section 1071 small business lending data rule represents a major operational undertaking, requiring technology integration, staff training, and process redesign across the organization. Non-bank lenders face heightened scrutiny from both federal and state regulators. Compliance infrastructure must be robust without slowing lending operations or customer experience.

**Technology Modernization and Digital Transformation**  
Customer expectations have shifted toward digital-first experiences. Borrowers want instant approvals, transparent pricing, and seamless application processes. Lenders are investing in AI-driven underwriting, automated decisioning, and alternative data integration (such as utility payments, rental history, and cash flow data). However, legacy loan origination systems and core servicing platforms often can't support these capabilities without significant investment. Balancing technology modernization with operational stability and regulatory compliance is challenging. Implementation must be managed carefully to ensure adoption and minimize disruption.

**Operational Efficiency and Process Consistency**  
Loan origination, underwriting, servicing, and collections involve multiple handoffs, manual reviews, and system integrations. Processes often vary by product line, geography, or even individual loan officer. Inefficiency increases costs, slows turnaround times, and creates inconsistent customer experiences. When processes evolved organically over years, standardization becomes difficult. Mapping current state, identifying bottlenecks, and redesigning workflows requires dedicated effort—but without it, operational costs remain high and customer satisfaction suffers.

**Workforce Capacity and Expertise**  
Lending organizations need specialized talent: underwriters, credit analysts, loan officers, compliance specialists, and collection agents. Competition for experienced talent is intense, and turnover in high-stress roles (collections, customer service) is common. When senior underwriters or loan officers leave, institutional knowledge about credit policies, customer relationships, and workflow nuances goes with them. Building a stable, high-performing workforce requires thoughtful organizational design, career development, and retention strategies.

## Where Executives Get Stuck
*Common friction points in organizational performance*

**You can't see where critical underwriting expertise and customer relationships reside.**  
Org charts show reporting lines, but they don't reveal which underwriters informally mentor the team, which loan officers have the strongest borrower relationships, or which credit analysts connect risk management with operations. When you restructure or lose key people, you discover how much institutional knowledge was invisible. Identifying these critical knowledge holders before they leave is essential—but most lenders don't have visibility into informal networks.

**Change initiatives don't stick.**  
You implemented a new loan origination system or automated underwriting platform. You invested in training and communications. Months later, adoption is inconsistent. Underwriters still use workarounds because "the old system was faster." Loan officers don't utilize new features. If employees don't adopt new tools and processes, transformation efforts fail. The technology works when people use it—and getting people to change behavior requires more than training.

**Processes are inconsistent across products and regions.**  
Underwriting standards vary. Loan servicing quality differs by office. Some teams have efficient workflows; others are buried in manual tasks. When processes evolve organically, inefficiency and inconsistency become embedded. You know standardization would improve results and reduce risk, but mapping current state and redesigning workflows feels overwhelming. Without a structured approach, improvement efforts stall.

**Compliance and growth feel like competing priorities.**  
You need to grow loan volume to hit targets, but compliance teams are concerned about fair lending risk, data accuracy, and regulatory examinations. Business units say compliance slows everything down. Compliance teams say underwriting is taking shortcuts. Finding the balance is difficult. Lenders that manage this tension well pull ahead. Those that don't get stuck between growth pressure and regulatory risk.

**Collections and loss mitigation are reactive, not proactive.**  
When loans go delinquent, collections teams scramble. Loss mitigation efforts are inconsistent. Some borrowers get proactive outreach; others don't hear from you until accounts are seriously past due. Early intervention could prevent many defaults, but most lenders don't have processes or capacity for proactive portfolio monitoring and borrower engagement. Building proactive collections and loss mitigation requires process redesign, technology, and cultural change.

## How Rooted Helps Credit & Lending Leaders
*Our approach to organizational strategy and transformation*

Rooted Advisory Group works with consumer lenders, commercial lending divisions, specialty finance companies, and credit unions to address operational and organizational challenges. We bring senior-level expertise in organizational strategy, change management, process optimization, and organizational development. Our approach is practical, data-driven, and designed to deliver measurable results.

### Organizational Network Analysis: See How Work Really Happens
*Understanding informal networks, knowledge flows, and collaboration patterns*

Lending organizations are complex, with underwriting, credit risk, operations, servicing, and collections functions that must coordinate effectively. Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) reveals the informal networks that drive performance—who people turn to for help, where knowledge resides, and where silos create friction.

**Before workforce reductions, protect critical expertise.** When cost pressures force layoffs or restructuring, you need to know who holds critical knowledge. ONA shows which underwriters informally train others, which credit analysts are go-to resources, and which loan officers have the strongest borrower relationships. You can make reduction decisions strategically and avoid accidentally cutting the people who make everything work.

**During technology implementations, identify key influencers.** When you launch new systems, adoption depends on influential employees. ONA reveals which underwriters and loan officers others look to for guidance. By engaging these key influencers early, addressing their concerns, and enlisting them as champions, you drive adoption across the organization.

**When performance varies, understand why.** If some underwriting teams or branches consistently outperform others, ONA can reveal differences in collaboration, knowledge sharing, and informal mentoring. You can identify what high performers do differently and replicate those patterns across your organization.

**Improve collaboration between credit risk, operations, and business units.** Silos kill efficiency in lending. Underwriting doesn't talk to servicing. Credit risk operates separately from business development. ONA maps communication patterns and highlights where collaboration breaks down. Once you see the gaps, you can design interventions that connect the right people.

### Change Management: Make Transformation Stick
*Structured approaches to adoption and behavior change*

Lending organizations face constant change—regulatory shifts, technology implementations, process redesigns, credit policy updates. Organizations that execute change well maintain competitive advantage and regulatory compliance. Those that don't waste resources on initiatives that never deliver results.

**Technology implementations that underwriters and loan officers actually use.** You're implementing a new loan origination system, automated underwriting platform, or servicing system. Technical implementation is critical—but so is adoption. Rooted partners with your IT and operations teams to ensure end users are engaged from day one. We develop role-specific training, build feedback loops to address pain points quickly, and create sustainability plans so people don't revert to old workarounds.

**Credit policy and underwriting standard changes.** When you tighten or loosen credit standards, underwriters need to understand why and how to apply new criteria consistently. Rooted helps you design change programs that include clear communication, hands-on training, and quality assurance processes to ensure consistent application of new standards.

**Regulatory compliance implementations.** When new regulations like Section 1071 take effect, compliance teams understand the requirements—but the broader organization doesn't always know what's changing or why. Rooted helps you communicate the business rationale, train affected teams on new processes, and embed compliance into daily operations. This isn't just about passing examinations—it's about building a culture where compliance and business objectives align.

**Collections and loss mitigation process improvements.** Shifting from reactive to proactive collections requires cultural change. Collections staff are used to working accounts that are already delinquent. Proactive outreach to at-risk borrowers requires different skills and mindsets. Rooted designs change programs that help staff understand the value of early intervention, provide training on new approaches, and create incentives that reward proactive engagement.

### Business Process Engineering: Optimize How Work Gets Done
*Process mapping, redesign, and operational efficiency*

Inefficient processes cost lenders millions in wasted time, increased operational costs, and poor customer experiences. Business Process Engineering (BPE) is about mapping current-state workflows, identifying bottlenecks and redundancies, and redesigning processes for efficiency and effectiveness.

**Loan origination and underwriting process optimization.** Origination workflows often involve multiple handoffs, redundant data entry, and unclear decision authority. Rooted maps your end-to-end origination process—from application to funding—and identifies where time is lost. We redesign processes to eliminate waste, standardize decision criteria, introduce automation where appropriate, and empower underwriters to move faster on straightforward applications while escalating complex cases appropriately.

**Credit decisioning and approval workflow improvements.** Approval workflows often have unnecessary review layers that slow decisions without adding value. Rooted analyzes your credit decisioning process to identify bottlenecks. We redesign approval authority matrices, create tiered decision protocols, and streamline escalation processes. The result: faster decisions, better customer experience, and more efficient use of senior underwriter time.

**Loan servicing and payment processing efficiency.** Servicing operations involve payment processing, account maintenance, customer inquiries, and exception handling. Rooted maps these workflows to find inefficiencies. Are payment posting processes manual? Are customer service representatives duplicating work? Is exception handling inconsistent? We redesign processes to reduce errors, accelerate processing, and improve borrower satisfaction.

**Collections and loss mitigation process redesign.** Effective collections balance recovery with borrower relationships. Rooted maps your collections workflow—from early-stage delinquency through charge-off—and identifies opportunities for improvement. We design proactive monitoring processes that identify at-risk borrowers early, create segmented collections strategies based on delinquency stage and borrower profile, and implement loss mitigation protocols that maximize recovery while treating borrowers fairly.

### Organizational Development & Effectiveness: Build a Stronger Foundation
*Structure, strategy, culture, and leadership alignment*

Organizational Development & Effectiveness (OD&E) is about aligning structure, strategy, and culture so your lending organization can execute at a high level. For lending leaders, OD&E addresses fundamental questions: Is our operating model efficient? Do we have the right leadership pipeline? Are we building a culture that balances growth with sound risk management?

**Operating model redesign for efficiency and agility.** Many lending organizations are organized by product line or geography with functional silos. This structure creates friction. Cross-functional collaboration is slow. Decision-making is bureaucratic. Rooted works with leadership teams to evaluate alternative models—such as centralized underwriting, shared services, or product-line structures—that balance specialization with efficiency. We help you design structures that support your strategy, then guide implementation.

**Leadership development and succession planning.** Lending has a leadership pipeline challenge. Experienced chief credit officers, underwriting leaders, and servicing managers are retiring. Rooted uses ONA to identify emerging leaders who already have influence and credibility. We design development programs that build strategic and operational capabilities, and we help you create succession plans that include coaching and thoughtful transitions.

**Post-merger or acquisition integration.** When lenders merge or acquire loan portfolios, integration is complex. Systems, credit policies, and cultures must align. Rooted facilitates operating model design sessions where leadership defines the future state, then builds implementation roadmaps that sequence changes logically and manage organizational capacity.

**Culture and values alignment.** Culture drives behavior, and behavior drives credit quality and customer experience. If your stated values are "responsible lending" but your incentives reward volume over quality, there's a disconnect. Rooted helps leadership teams define authentic values, then translate them into tangible behaviors and decision-making criteria. We work with managers to embed culture into hiring, performance management, and daily leadership.

## Common Scenarios Where Rooted Adds Value
*Practical applications and client outcomes*

**Scenario: Loan origination turnaround times are too long and hurting competitiveness.** A consumer lender is losing business to competitors because loan decisions take 5-7 days while competitors approve loans in 24 hours. The COO knows the process is inefficient but doesn't know where to start. Rooted maps the end-to-end origination workflow and identifies that applications sit in queues waiting for underwriter review, data verification is manual, and approval workflows have unnecessary layers. We redesign the process: implement automated income and employment verification, create tiered underwriting authority so straightforward applications are auto-decisioned, and eliminate redundant approval steps. After implementation, average turnaround drops to 36 hours, application volume increases by 22%, and customer satisfaction improves.

**Scenario: A new loan origination system has low adoption among underwriters.** A commercial lender invested $4M in a modern LOS designed to improve efficiency and credit decisioning. Ten months post-launch, adoption among underwriters is at 35%. Leadership is frustrated. Rooted conducts interviews and learns that senior underwriters find the system slower for complex deals and have told junior underwriters to "just use the old way." We bring influential underwriters into a feedback group to address usability issues, create streamlined workflows for common loan types, and identify champions. Within four months, adoption rises to 82%, and underwriting efficiency improves by 18%.

**Scenario: Credit card delinquencies are rising, but collections capacity is strained.** A regional bank's credit card portfolio is experiencing rising delinquencies. Collections staff are overwhelmed working seriously delinquent accounts, and early-stage delinquencies aren't getting attention. The Chief Risk Officer knows early intervention could prevent many accounts from becoming seriously delinquent but doesn't have capacity. Rooted maps the collections workflow and identifies that all delinquent accounts receive the same treatment regardless of risk or stage. We redesign the process: implement automated early-stage outreach (emails, texts) for 30-day delinquencies, segment accounts by risk score and customize collection strategies, and reallocate staff to focus on high-risk accounts that need human intervention. After implementation, roll rates from 30-day to 60-day delinquency decrease by 35%, and overall charge-offs decline by 18%.

**Scenario: Section 1071 compliance implementation is behind schedule and over budget.** A business lender with a March 2026 compliance deadline for Section 1071 is struggling with implementation. Technology integration is delayed, business units don't understand data collection requirements, and staff aren't trained. The CEO is concerned about regulatory risk. Rooted conducts a compliance readiness assessment, identifies gaps in technology, process, and training, and builds an accelerated implementation plan. We facilitate cross-functional working sessions to align IT, compliance, and business units, create data collection workflows integrated into origination processes, and design role-specific training. The lender meets the compliance deadline, and post-implementation audits confirm data quality and completeness.

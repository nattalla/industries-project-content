## Industry Context: Strong Capital Position Amid Evolving Risks
*Managing catastrophe exposure, pricing discipline, and operational complexity*

The global reinsurance sector enters 2025 in a strong financial position following years of market correction. Global reinsurer capital reached $715 billion as of September 2024, reflecting a $45 billion increase since the end of 2023, driven primarily by retained earnings.¹ The industry posted a combined ratio of 91.4% and an annualized return on equity of 16.2% through the first nine months of 2024.² Despite insured catastrophe losses exceeding $140 billion in 2024—including significant impacts from Hurricanes Milton and Helene and California wildfires—reinsurers maintained profitability through improved pricing, tightened terms, and disciplined underwriting.

However, the outlook for 2025 presents a complex picture. Property catastrophe reinsurance pricing has softened from its peak due to abundant capacity, while casualty reinsurance faces double-digit price increases driven by social inflation and rising litigation costs.³ Climate change continues to drive catastrophe frequency and severity. Geopolitical tensions and economic inflation complicate risk modeling and capital allocation decisions.

For executives leading reinsurance companies and reinsurance brokers, the operational environment demands balancing competing priorities: maintaining underwriting discipline as markets soften, managing catastrophe exposure amid climate change, adapting to evolving regulatory frameworks (including IFRS 17), and building organizational capacity to handle increasingly complex risks while maintaining profitability.

## Common Operational Challenges
*Catastrophe exposure, reserve adequacy, pricing discipline, and operational efficiency*

**Catastrophe Exposure Management and Climate Change**  
Natural catastrophes remain the largest risk for reinsurers. Insured catastrophe losses have exceeded $100 billion for five consecutive years, with severe convective storms alone accounting for $64 billion in 2023.⁴ Climate change is increasing both frequency and severity of weather events—wildfires, floods, hurricanes, and secondary perils like hail. Reinsurers must balance providing catastrophe coverage (which is profitable when priced correctly) with managing aggregate exposure limits. Catastrophe modeling becomes more challenging as historical loss data becomes less predictive. Geographic concentration risk, attachment point decisions, and aggregate limit management require sophisticated analysis and disciplined decision-making.

**Casualty Reserve Adequacy and Social Inflation**  
Social inflation—rising litigation costs, larger jury awards, and expanding liability interpretations—is driving adverse loss development in U.S. casualty lines, particularly workers' compensation, commercial auto, and professional liability. "Nuclear verdicts" (jury awards exceeding $10 million) have tripled since 2015, reaching $18.3 billion in 2022.⁵ Casualty reserves established in prior years are proving inadequate, forcing reinsurers to strengthen reserves and raise prices. Managing long-tail casualty business requires actuarial expertise, legal trend monitoring, and conservative reserving practices—but pricing increases lag loss cost trends, creating profitability pressure.

**Pricing Discipline and Market Cycle Management**  
Reinsurance is notoriously cyclical. After years of rate inadequacy and soft market conditions, 2023-2024 saw meaningful price corrections. However, as capital floods back into the market and competition increases, pricing discipline weakens. Despite universal agreement that "underwriting discipline must be maintained," reinsurers historically struggle to resist growth temptation when rates soften. Executives face pressure from shareholders to deploy capital and grow premium volume, even when pricing deteriorates. Maintaining discipline requires strong leadership, clear risk appetite frameworks, and willingness to walk away from inadequately priced business—decisions that are easier to articulate than execute.

**Regulatory Complexity and IFRS 17 Implementation**  
IFRS 17, which became effective January 1, 2023, has created significant operational complexity. The new accounting standard fundamentally changes how reinsurance contracts are measured and reported. Many reinsurers have adopted IFRS 17, creating challenges as they adjust to its provisions. The difference between written premiums under the old standard and reinsurance revenue under IFRS 17 makes historical comparisons difficult. IFRS 17 combined ratios are discounted differently than previous standards. The requirements can create accounting mismatches and profit/loss volatility depending on reinsurance management strategy. Complying with IFRS 17 while also managing regulatory requirements across multiple jurisdictions (Solvency II in Europe, state regulations in the U.S., varied requirements in emerging markets) creates significant compliance burden.

**Operational Efficiency and Technology Modernization**  
Reinsurance operations involve complex workflows: contract negotiation and placement, risk assessment and pricing, portfolio management, claims handling, and catastrophe response. Many reinsurers still rely on legacy systems for policy administration, claims processing, and financial reporting. Manual processes, fragmented data, and system limitations reduce efficiency. Underwriters spend significant time on administrative tasks rather than risk assessment. Claims adjusting after catastrophes is resource-intensive and requires surge capacity. Modernizing operations—implementing data analytics, improving workflow automation, enhancing catastrophe modeling—requires investment and change management that competes with other capital deployment priorities.

## Where Executives Get Stuck
*Common friction points in organizational performance*

**You can't see where critical underwriting expertise and client relationships reside.**  
Org charts show reporting lines, but they don't reveal which underwriters informally mentor junior staff, which actuaries are go-to resources for complex reserve analyses, or which client relationship managers have the strongest cedent partnerships. When you restructure or lose key people—through retirement, departure to competitors, or acquisition—you discover how much institutional knowledge and relationship strength was tied to individuals. Identifying these critical knowledge holders before transitions occur is essential but difficult.

**Underwriting discipline weakens when markets soften.**  
Everyone agrees discipline is essential. Leadership communicates it. Underwriters know it. But when competitors offer lower prices and cedents shop for better terms, saying "no" to business is difficult. Individual underwriters face pressure to hit volume targets. Relationship managers want to maintain cedent partnerships. Slowly, pricing discipline erodes—not through dramatic decisions but through incremental concessions that accumulate. Without strong governance frameworks and leadership willing to accept short-term volume declines to preserve long-term profitability, discipline weakens.

**Catastrophe response is reactive rather than proactive.**  
When major catastrophes hit, reinsurers scramble to assess exposure, deploy claims adjusters, and manage cedent relationships. Response effectiveness varies by event and location. Some catastrophes are handled smoothly; others expose operational gaps. Building proactive catastrophe response capabilities—pre-event planning, surge capacity agreements, clear communication protocols, efficient claims workflows—requires investment during quiet periods when catastrophe budgets haven't been exhausted. Most reinsurers don't systematically build these capabilities until after problematic events expose weaknesses.

**Data and analytics capabilities lag industry needs.**  
Reinsurance pricing and risk assessment increasingly depend on sophisticated data analytics, catastrophe modeling, and predictive tools. However, many reinsurers still rely on legacy systems, fragmented data sources, and manual analyses. Data scientists and modelers exist but often operate separately from underwriters. Integrating analytics into underwriting workflows, training underwriters to use new tools, and building data-driven decision-making culture requires organizational change that's difficult to execute while managing daily business operations.

**Talent development and succession planning are reactive.**  
Reinsurance requires specialized expertise: underwriting, actuarial science, catastrophe modeling, claims management. Many senior underwriters and actuaries are approaching retirement. Succession planning exists on paper, but development of successors is often inadequate. When senior professionals leave, knowledge transfer is rushed or incomplete. Building effective talent pipelines requires years of intentional development, mentorship programs, and knowledge capture—but these initiatives often take backseat to immediate business priorities.

### Organizational Network Analysis: Understand How Work Really Happens
*Mapping expertise, relationships, and collaboration patterns*

Reinsurance organizations depend on specialized expertise and strong client relationships. Organizational Network Analysis (ONA) reveals the informal networks that drive performance—which underwriters others turn to for complex risk assessment, where actuarial knowledge resides, and which client relationships are strongest.

**Before workforce transitions, protect critical expertise and relationships.** When restructuring or facing retirements, ONA shows which underwriters informally mentor teams, which actuaries are go-to resources for reserving decisions, and which client managers have the strongest cedent relationships. You can design transition plans that protect institutional knowledge and client continuity.

**When underwriting performance varies, understand why.** If some underwriting teams consistently achieve better loss ratios and maintain pricing discipline while others struggle, ONA can reveal differences in collaboration, risk assessment approaches, and decision-making. You can identify what high performers do differently and replicate those patterns.

**Improve collaboration between underwriting, actuarial, and claims teams.** Silos reduce effectiveness in reinsurance. Underwriters don't consult actuaries enough on pricing. Claims insights don't inform underwriting decisions. ONA maps communication patterns and highlights where collaboration breaks down. Once you see the gaps, you can design interventions that connect the right people.
